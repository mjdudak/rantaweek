So&#8230; what is it?

RantAWeek is a political and world news blog designed to explain and offer analysis on trending news topics.

Don’t blogs tend to heavily favor either Republican or Democratic views?

Here at RantAWeek, you will see winners being picked in disputes and arguments that favor a certain outcome.  However, no Republican or Democratic agendas are being followed and final opinions are left to the reader.

What is the ‘per week’ hint given in the &#8216;a week&#8217; part of your name?

While there is no exact &#8216;per week&#8217; posting schedule, we here at RantAWeek prefer to give readers an in-depth article, with the exception of the occasional live blog, rather than minute-by-minute news updates, which are best left to large-scale news agencies.

How can political ‘rants’ still be well thought out?

Our definition of a rant is hardly the half-comprehensible screaming of someone on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  A RantAWeek political rant is simply a forum for an author to submit his or her views on a certain topic.

Can I respond to a rant?

Sure, we love constructive criticism and others’ views. Feel free to send us an email or leave a comment, but please be respectful, not only of us, but also of other commentors. If you are vulgar, obscene or disrespectful, there is a chance that we will ban your email from commenting, and that comment will be deleted.  RantAWeek reserves the right to delete any comment for any reason.
