You may have noticed the RantAcademy page that has sat atop the site &#8216;under construction&#8217; for the last two months.  That construction will end **Friday, June 8th**, and we will launch RantAcademy.  The purpose of RantAcademy is to provide background knowledge for topics discussed on this site as well as providing a basis for future research.  We apologize for the delay, but hope that you will find this addition useful.

Thanks,

The Editors.
