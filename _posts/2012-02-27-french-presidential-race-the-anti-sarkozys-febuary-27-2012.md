As our election at home is starting to heat up, especially with the upcoming [Michigan primary](http://rantaweek.com/live-blogs/michigan-live-blog-2/ "Michigan Live Blog"), we must remember that we are not the only ones in the world. 2012 is election season all over the world, and one election that is concerning many is the French Presidential election. With the first round being held on April 22nd, and a run-off being held May 6th, if necessary, this election is quickly approaching. The French presidential election is one of great economic importance as the leader of France will have to, with Angela Merkel, lead the Eurozone towards recovery. So let&#8217;s take a look at the candidates and how they may faire, as well as how they will impact France as a whole.

First up, the incumbent, Nicolas Sarkozy, of the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP), a right-centre party. Sarkozy has been largely unpopular for the past several years, with unemployment nearing 10%, and his approval ratings hovering just above 20%. Many associate him with economic woes that the rest of the country and Eurozone is experiencing. Especially detrimental are his austerity measures, because the French are extremely attached to their social welfare programs. Sarkozy is mainly running on the platform that he has avoided complete economic catastrophe. However, his proposal to fix the economy is primarily to cut welfare, and avoid raising taxes. He is currently predicted to do well enough to make it into a run-off if it is needed, but not well enough to win the presidency.

Second, the front runner, Francois Hollande, a Socialist. The French presidency has not been held by a Socialist since 1995, when Francois Mitterrand held the office. Leading up to this election, many predicted that Dominique Strauss-Kahn, a Socialist, and former Director of the IMF would run and likely win. However, in May of 2011, a sexual assault case was brought against Strauss-Kahn. Ultimately, he was released as the accuser lied to a grand jury. However this forced him to resign from his position at the IMF and led to a huge drop in popularity in France. Recently, he was arrested and charged with another sexual assault case, but he does not affect the race any more. Since Strauss-Kahn was not going to run, Hollande, leader of the Socialist party announced his run. Most of his campaign has simply been marked by being an Anti-Sarkozy. However, as Marine Le Pen (discussed later) is gaining popularity, Hollande has had to establish his actual platform. His platform is one of equality. He decided that he is going to try to balance to budget, and make France bring back the revolutionary spirit of &#8220;egalite.&#8221; He will do so through tax hikes and keeping social welfare programs in place. If the elections were to be held today, Hollande would win, but he is losing ground.

The final major contender is Marine Le Pen from the extreme right National Front. Le Pen is sort of a French version of Santorum. She is extremely conservative, both fiscally and socially. She has had a special focus on limiting immigration into France. She is currently in third place, but is threatening to overtake Sarkozy. Le Pen exemplifies the far-right movement that has been sweeping Europe and presents herself as another Anti-Sarkozy. She is taking away many supporters of Sarkozy because they are both vying for the same demographic. Le Pen will have to overcome Sarkozy in order to get a chance at a run-off.

These three candidates are so close and split the vote so evenly that a run-off election seems inevitable. This run off will likely be Hollande going against either Sarkozy or Le Pen, depending on who is more popularÂ  on April 22nd. Le Pen has momentum and may very well overtake Sarkozy. Who wins the run-off is anyone&#8217;s game, although Hollande seems most likely currently. The biggest problem that Hollande faces is the rise of the far-right. Hollande may very well fall the way that previous Socialist candidates have, losing elections that seem inevitable. So while we look home to our own primaries and election, we must keep the French elections in the back of our minds as it will likely shape the future of the Eurozone, and the world economy as a whole.
