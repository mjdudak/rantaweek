While the Republican candidates have already garnered a significant portion of the news, I would like to remind everyone that the Election of 2012 is still over a year away.  That being said, a glance away from the individual candidates and into the wider picture is probably a good idea.  And the widest focus possible in any presidential election is undoubtedly the Electoral College.

Whoa! It’s best to pause here, and allow for a short U.S. history lesson.  The Electoral College was included in the Constitution to safeguard against unbridled democracy.  Our Founding Fathers wanted to protect their highest office from the unbridled whims of the American people and place it in the ‘safer’ minds of a few choice electors.  While this conservative safeguard has been whittled away throughout the decades to pave way for greater democracy, its basic shell does remain.  Americans do not vote for their leader, but instead choose people to cast votes for them.  And it creates some very interesting results…

In four elections (1824, 1876, 1888, and most recently and most memorably 2000), the winner of the popular vote has not gone on to the Presidency.   While this in itself clearly takes away from the “rule by the people” that America is supposed to embody, it also poses other problems.  One of the results of the Electoral College awarding votes on a state by state basis is that the losing votes in any given state are completely discarded.  For example, if New Mexico is won by 400,000 votes to 399,999, the minority votes in that state matter no more than if the vote was 400,000 to 0.  While the minority votes must be discarded at some point, and the election made winner take all, it makes much more sense for this to happen at the national level to stop discrepancies between the winner of the popular vote and the eventual winner of the presidency.

It is also important to realize that candidates, due to the Electoral College, treat different states differently.   Solidly red states or solidly blue states are virtually ignored while millions of dollars worth of advertising is poured into the hotly contested swing states.  Living in Illinois, politicians care less about my vote than they would if I lived in a swing state such as Florida.  But the state-to-state bias does not stop there.  The appropriation of Electoral College votes is not determined by population as many believe.  Instead, the number of electors is determined from the number of representatives each state has in Congress.  The two senators each state has skew these appropriations, making a single vote in sparsely populated states worth much more than a single vote in heavily populated states.  The basis of this rests in the very creation of the Constitution itself, as the Electoral College was more of a compromise between large and small states than anything else.  But in the words of Jefferson, “…laws and institutions must go hand in hand with the progress of the human mind.  As that becomes more developed, more enlightened, as new discoveries are made, new truths disclosed, and manners and opinions change with the change of circumstances, institutions must advance also and keep pace with the times.<sup>(1)</sup>”

The Electoral College has not advanced with the pace of time, and now stands as a barrier to American democracy.  Our constitution is not a perfect document, and it would be greatly improved with the removal of our current presidential election system, allowing it to better represent the people. &#8211; TM
