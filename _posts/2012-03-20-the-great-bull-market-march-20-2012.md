It has been three long years since the bottom of the equities plunge in March 2009.  Since the turnaround, major stock indices have once again been churning out rather large profits.  The S&P 500, a commonly cited index, has doubled in value.  Many investors have been warily reentering the markets, hoping that the three-year long recovery can continue, doling out more money in the process.

Still, causeless optimism in the financial markets is always fodder for doubt.  Most stock indices are now higher than they were immediately before the rapid value drop in late 2008, causing concern over whether or not the economy truly should be considered at pre-recession strength.

By examining the simplest economic statistic, GDP growth, these concerns appear to be unfulfilled.  While the economy was contracting as indices fell in late 2008 and early 2009, GDP growth is once again on the rise, and the economy has overseen ten back-to-back quarters of GDP growth*.  It makes sense that as GDP rises, the markets will as well.

But the entire economy can not be summed up so easily.  We must also examine a more personal economic indicator in unemployment data.  Back in March 2009, when the markets were at their lowest, unemployment was at 8.7%.  The most recent unemployment numbers from February of this year show unemployment at 8.3%.  This seems to be a modest improvement.  However, just one year before those March &#8217;09 woes, unemployment was at a measly 5.1%**.  Using this broader scope to peer into unemployment levels, we realize that the unemployment problem is far from over.  It also may be scary to realize that the last time stocks were near current levels, unemployment was much, much lower.

A couple unemployment numbers should not send everyone running to sell all of their stocks.  More analysis is needed, and market valuations are a good way to start this analysis.  P/E ratios are used to determine the valuation of a stock by comparing price (P) with earnings (E).  The lower the P/E ratio, the more money the underlying company is making in regards to its cost.  Compared to pre-recession P/E values, stocks can no longer be considered cheap, but they are also most certainly not expensive in regards to earnings.  P/E appears to be more or less a wash.

So, using different indicators, we learn different things about the strength of the three year long rally.  Remember, mixed signals like these always persist, and it is impossible to predict with constant accuracy the future of the market.  This uncertainty is why there is no specific reason to believe stocks are ready for an imminent crash.  But also, it is foolish to think that the climb will continue indefinitely.  Equities are always a risk, and the only definitive statements that can be made about them is their past performance, never their future moves.
