North Korea is back to its old tricks.  Last month, the U.S. and North Korea reached [an agreement](http://rantaweek.com/change-in-north-korea-march-3-2012/ "Change in North Korea- March 3, 2012") in which the U.S. would give North Korea  much needed food aid if the latter halted their nuclear program.  One of the specific things that the U.S. mentioned the North Koreans would have to do in order to receive aid was the suspension of all missile tests.  Shockingly, North Korea has since announced plans to launch a satellite into space next month.

Yes, a satellite is very different from a missile, but American foreign policy has been clear in dictating that, because the technology involved in launching these objects is quite similar, any launch should be labelled as a provocation.  The North Koreans fervently disagree, saying that the launch has nothing to do with advancing their nuclear program and is merely a 100th birthday memorial for their founder, Kim Il-sung.

At stake is the tentative agreement that was sketched out in late February.  The U.S. feels that any launch would break the agreement, and has already cancelled food aid.  The North Koreans, on the other hand, feel that they have every right to launch a peaceful satellite and believe that the Americans are reneging on their promises, not the other way around.

President Obama has not been passive about this situation.  With impeccable timing, the Seoul nuclear security summit took place this week in South Korea.  In Seoul, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak, and U.S. President Obama, in addition to many other leaders, have created a consensus that the North Koreans are in the wrong and that the launch should be met with universal disapproval.

However, President Lee and his party face domestic consequences for this international problem.  The satellite launch is expected to occur mere days after South Korea holds elections for their National Assembly on April 11th.  As voters go to the polls, the satellite will be a serious factor in their decisions.  Election troubles will also be seen in America, as any actions that President Obama makes will have to be cautious ones during the American election season.  Obama must not only worry about the North Korean reaction to any steps he takes, but also the reaction of the American voting public.

Still, no matter what they are threatened with, North Korean leaders tend to stubbornly follow their own plans and ignore the world&#8217;s condemnations.  With that knowledge, what matters now is not whether or not the satellite is launched, but instead what the reactions to it will be.
