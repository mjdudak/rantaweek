Two years after a surge of troops, and a week before expected, all 33,000 troops that were sent to Afghanistan in the 2010 surge have now left. This still leaves 68,000 troops in Afghanistan, but there are significantly less. This demonstrates a vital turning point in the United States&#8217; longest war in history. This October, the US-led coalition of Nato troops will have been in Afghanistan for 11 years. Many people, both in Afghanistan, and the US are starting to feel war fatigue. Yet the question still remains: can Afghanistan stand on its own?

Initially, the answer may appear to be yes. The main cities of Afghanistan have seen violence rates plummet in the past few months, despite diminishing numbers of US troops in the cities. Additionally, the surge successfully turned back Taliban momentum in the southwestern regions of Afghanistan. Yet on further inspection, the answer starts to lean towards no, for several reasons.

First, recent internal attacks on US forces demonstrate that the Afghan police and military may not be up to the task. Recently, a number of Afghan allies have been infiltrated by the Taliban and in turn attacked US forces. This may very well highlight the Afghan force&#8217;s inability to weed out Taliban members and prevent them from causing more harm. Additionally, this has lead to Nato forces cutting back training exercises with Afghan forces for fear that this may happen again.

Second, many experts believe that the Taliban in simply waiting for US troops to leave in order to make a comeback. Because of their nature as an insurgent group that still has the support of many people within Afghanistan, it would not be hard for the Taliban to simply regroup and reform in 2014, the predicted date when troops will leave. Also, even though violence in cities has been largely subdued, the Taliban continues to have a large, and violent, hold on many more rural regions. Because there are more troops in the cities, both Afghan and Nato, they are able to better provide for the people living, thus making the influence of the Taliban lessened. Yet in the countryside, the Taliban continues to sway people and therefore has a larger presence.

Finally, the economic conditions of Afghanistan are abysmal. As [previously discussed](http://rantaweek.com/keeping-afghanistan-stable-after-nato/ "Keeping Afghanistan Stable, After NATO"), there is a general fear that the Nato troop pull out will leave the Afghan economy devastated. Considering that, by some estimates, a mixture of foreign aid and military spending accounts forÂ  97% of Afghanistan&#8217;s economy. This makes Afghanistan&#8217;s economy only worth $545mn, or about $20 per capita. Clearly, the Afghan economy cannot stand on its own without foreign aid and military spending on things like clothing for the military. A large fear here is that if the troop pullout has as devastating of an effect on Afghanistan as is predicted, many Afghan people will simply turn back to the Taliban for a sense of stability.

As of right now, Afghanistan is not yet prepared to stand on its own. The Taliban simply remains in a position to regain too much power quickly. Rather than handing Afghanistan over just to Afghan troops, the US may be better off handing it over to more regional powers, such as Pakistan. Not only does Pakistan have a self-interest in helping Afghanistan, for economic and political reasons, but Pakistan may be able to help Afghanistan more than any other country. With a mixture of similar culture and similar problems, Pakistan and Afghanistan can work together to expel the Taliban, and the Haqanni Network, a Pakistani terrorist organization.

If a handover were to occur now, the Taliban would certainly come right back into power. However if the US can make huge strides in the next two years, both in raising a better Afghan security force and in establishing a better Afghan economy, a 2014 pullout may feasibly leave Afghan in an okay state. However, if the US can instead hand off Afghanistan to Pakistan, having already dealt with many of the biggest problems, a transition may be much more effective and leave a more stable Afghanistan.
