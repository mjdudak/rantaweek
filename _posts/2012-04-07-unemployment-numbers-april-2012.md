The unemployment rate has dropped once again, falling from 8.3% to 8.2%.  On the surface, this may seem like a minor step forward, but closer inspection shows that the new jobs report is not necessarily a thing to celebrate.

First of all, the term &#8216;unemployment rate&#8217; is much more confusing than it sounds.  Instead of being a simple calculation for the percent of unemployed persons divided by the total labor force, the commonly cited unemployment rate is actually a much more technical calculation.  The current rate of 8.2% only measures the percentage of the total labor force that is not working and has actively sought a new job.  The effect of this definition is that people who have given up searching for a job or have refrained from job hunting, in addition to those who have accepted part time jobs even though they want full time ones, are completely excluded from our most commonly cited unemployment statistics.  Including these people, the unemployment rate jumps from 8.2% to 14.5%.*

This much higher number, known as the U-6 rate, gives a different and slightly more grim view of the jobs market.  While this nearly doubled unemployment rate is a little scary at first glance, we can take some comfort in the fact that like its lower relative, the U-6 rate has been falling during recent months.

Unfortunately, falling numbers do not always mean a brighter future lies ahead for the job market.  Take that 8.3 to 8.2 percent drop for the &#8216;normal&#8217; unemployment rate mentioned at the beginning of this article.  That was partially caused by nonfarm payrolls adding 120,000 jobs during the month of March.**  The bad news: expectations were much higher.  Job gains from the first two months of the year dwarf this mediocre increase, and the suddenness of the slowdown leads to worries that the recovery in employment is not as strong as previous numbers suggested.

Still, March&#8217;s numbers may only be a one-month drop.  As of now, it is impossible to know whether they will start a worrying trend or whether they are simply a false alarm.  The only solid conclusion is that these unemployment numbers will have serious political consequences.  Republicans, including Mitt Romney, have already jumped on the report as a way to criticize President Obama&#8217;s handling of the economy.  Subsequent data releases in the next few months will set the tone for the unemployment situation leading to the election.  Since unemployment is sure to be one of the most important issues this year, Obama will hope for rosier reports as the election gets nearer.

Looking from a personal, not political viewpoint, it is also important to recognize that any increase of payroll numbers is better than skyrocketing unemployment.  We may not be improving by leaps and bounds, but at the very least some progress is being made, even if the numbers involved are a little confusing.
