When [Greek Parliamentary elections were last held](http://rantaweek.com/greece-election-may-2012/ "Greece: When Elections Fail – May 15, 2012") in May, the sudden rise to prominence of leftist party Syriza left the former ruling coalition short of a majority.  Attempts at making a new coalition ended in failure, which forced another election to be held.  This time around, Greek leaders do not have the luxury of calling for another round of elections.  Greece is in danger of running out of money if fiscal problems are not addressed in the coming weeks, and a government must be formed as soon as possible in order to deal with these problems.

Greece&#8217;s politics were too divided for any party to gain a majority, but it was clear in the days leading up to the election that the two parties vying for the largest percentage of votes were center-right New Democracy and leftist Syriza.  These two parties represent the two main camps in Greek politics right now.  New Democracy still supports the austerity programs that have come along with the bailouts Greece has received from its lenders.  Syriza, on the other hand, does not.

The results were close, but New Democracy managed to win a plurality of the vote with about 30% support.  While that means they will have the largest representation in Parliament, New Democracy is still about 22 seats short of a full majority.  That means New Democracy must form a coalition with another party in order to have a majority.  But which party?

Interestingly enough, New Democracy used to be in a coalition with a center-left party called PASOK.  That coalition would still be viable, but PASOK has made it clear that they will not enter into a coalition unless Sryiza also joins.  With New Democracy and Syriza wanting two different paths for Greece&#8217;s future, this three-party grand coalition would be difficult to manage.

New Democracy has other options.  They could try to convince several smaller parties to join together in order to form a coalition without PASOK or Syriza.  Then again, that could lead to a dysfunctional government as well.  Additionally, New Democracy leaders could plead with PASOK leaders to form a coalition without Syriza, but there is no guarantee that will work.

What parties will emerge as part of the coalition is not now known.  However, Syriza&#8217;s second place finish means that it is unlikely Greece will divert from its current course towards austerity anytime soon.  While there is some security in that knowledge for the many European leaders who feared a radical shift, it is clear that Greek leaders still have a lot of work ahead of them.
