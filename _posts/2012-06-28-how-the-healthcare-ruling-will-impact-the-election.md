The Democrats can expect enthusiasm from supporters of the bill, and this may create a short spike in Obama&#8217;s polling numbers.  Still, it is hard to envision the ruling creating a lasting upsurge in support for Obama that would help Democrats in an election more that is still more than 4 months away.  For example, Obama&#8217;s approval ratings jumped after the death of Bin Laden but returned to lower levels over the course of the next few months.

But while Bin Laden&#8217;s assassination was celebrated by America as a whole, polls suggest that more Americans are against the healthcare bill than for it.  Even though Obama&#8217;s legislative triumph has been upheld by a judicial victory, Republicans can now turn its repeal into a campaign issue.  Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has already stated that, if elected, he will work to repeal the law.

But Mitt Romney is entering dangerous waters if he tries to make the healthcare act&#8217;s repeal a foundational issue of his campaign.  Obama&#8217;s healthcare act looks suspiciously similar to a healthcare reform act Romney enacted while he was the governor of Massachusetts.  Many components of Obama&#8217;s legislation were actually taken from ideas that originated in the Massachusetts reform.  Romney will have a hard time arguing for the repeal of an act that he indirectly helped to create.

Democrats take a short-term win, and Republicans inherit a campaign issue that is tainted by Romney&#8217;s connections to the reforms.  No drastic changes to the election&#8217;s landscape seem likely.  4 months from now, Democrats will still be arguing that the act was a much needed fix to a broken system and Republicans will still be arguing that the act made the system worse.

With the law upheld, the issue of healthcare will most likely retake the backseat to economic issues.  After all, Romney has been campaigning with the [slogan](http://rantaweek.com/presidential-slogans-2012/ "Campaign Slogans: Obama and Romney") &#8220;Putting Jobs First&#8221; for a reason, unemployment and the overall economy are the driving issues for both campaigns, not healthcare.  While the act will still be an issue, expect jobs statistics to have a greater influence on the race.  The Supreme Court ruling was a one-time event, but jobs figures and economic statistics will continue to be released, recapturing the news.  It makes sense that voters will care more about October&#8217;s unemployment figures (released just four days before the election) than a four-month old healthcare decision when casting their ballots this November.

Yes, healthcare is a big deal.  However, the electoral effects of this ruling will be diminished by Election Day.  The nation watched with baited breath for the Supreme Court to make its decision, but now it will be back to politics as usual.
