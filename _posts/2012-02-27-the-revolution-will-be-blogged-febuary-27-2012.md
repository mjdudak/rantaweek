I recently wrote an essay about the rising influence of heterodox economic theories with the internet acting as a catalyst. It is very long so I did not want to make it a post itself, however it is it&#8217;s [own page](http://rantaweek.com/heterodox-economics/ "Heterodox Economics"). I hope that you read it, and get a better understanding of the two theories I discuss: Neo-Chartalism and the Austrian School, as well as Keynesian economics, which I also discuss. Enjoy!
