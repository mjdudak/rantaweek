Entering Super Tuesday, both Rick Santorum and Mitt Romney had a lot at stake.  There were two key battleground states: Ohio and Tennessee, where early polling did not show a clear winner.  What occurred was nothing more than a split decision, as Santorum won in Tennessee while Romney squeaked out a victory in Ohio.  Adding in the states that were less hotly contested, Romney won a total of 6 states Tuesday night.  Santorum picked up three and Gingrich won his home state of Georgia.

But as far as winning the nomination is concerned, states don&#8217;t matter.  Delegates, on the other hand, do.  One crucial goal  for Mitt Romney is ensuring that he can garner more than 50% of the total delegates so that the nomination can be decided before the Republican Convention in Tampa.  If the race for the nomination lasts that long, the eventual nominee will have a shortened length of time to solidify the party base and to campaign before the general election.  Romney knows that in order to show strength against Obama, he must win the nomination before the convention.

This is where &#8216;delegate math&#8217; comes in.  Romney faces a fundamental mathematical problem&#8230; he only has a plurality of support among Republicans on the national level, but he needs to acquire the majority of delegates.  In the past, this problem has been solved by states awarding delegates on a winner-take-all basis, helping to quickly bring the nominating process to a conclusion.  However, this year, more states have started to hand out delegates proportionally.  For example, even though Romney won in Ohio, Santorum still received 21 of Ohio&#8217;s delegates.

Still, there is some good news for Romney.  He has managed to win more than 50% of the delegates awarded so far, setting him on pace to win before the convention.  On the flip side, Romney has less than 40% of the total delegates he needs to clinch a majority and thus the nomination.  Simply put, this race is far from being over.

But what about Rick Santorum?  Well, Mr. Santorum proved that he still has the voter support to win states.  While upsetting Romney in Ohio would have been a big boost for his campaign, the fact that he still performed reasonably well will continue to bring him much needed funds.  If there is one strength that Romney is winning with above all others, it is the power of the purse.  Santorum&#8217;s best offense in the coming months is to establish fundraising that can rival Romney&#8217;s.

Also (somewhat) important to talk about are Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul.  Even though he only won Georgia on Super Tuesday, Gingrich remains adamant about staying in the race and is focused on trying to pick up a few more Southern states.  Like Santorum, he is hoping that he can prevent Romney from gaining the delegate majority.  Ron Paul&#8217;s campaign still lacks a win in any single state, and his lackluster support shows no signs of increasing.  However, Paul has pledged to continue with the race, meaning that he will still be a factor.  And since he can accumulate delegates in the states that disperse them proportionally, he will also hurt Romney&#8217;s chances for gaining a majority.

Super Tuesday is over, but the Republican nomination seems to be no closer to a conclusion.   Since the next round of voting is March 10th, it seems that the show will go on.
