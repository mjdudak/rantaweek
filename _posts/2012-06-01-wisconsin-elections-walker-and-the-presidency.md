After Republican Scott Walker won his Wisconsin gubernatorial race back in 2010, it didn&#8217;t take him long to become a figure of national controversy.  As part of his plans to help balance the state budget, he tried to cut costs by forcing government workers to contribute more money towards their pensions.  The proposal also planned to eliminate many collective bargaining rights.

Walker&#8217;s budget-cutting techniques have turned him into a polarizing figure.  Conservatives argue that he did exactly what he needed to do in order to balance the budget.  Liberals argue that he overstepped his authority and tried to destroy the techniques unions rely on.

Following its Progressive roots, Wisconsin responded to the political controversy through the organization of recall elections.  Several senatorial recall elections took place in 2011, but the most important one, the effort to recall Walker, will occur on June 5th.  However, early polls put Walker ahead of his Democratic opponent, and the odds seem to be in Walker&#8217;s favor.

Supporters of Walker view the apparent failure of the recall effort as a referendum in favor of conservatism in Wisconsin.  This interpretation creates effects beyond Walker&#8217;s gubernatorial race, as it may also have an impact on the presidency.

When RantAWeek examined [tossup states for the Presidential election](http://rantaweek.com/the-electoral-college-doing-the-math-april-27-2012/ "The Electoral College: Doing the Math – April 27, 2012"), we didn&#8217;t include Wisconsin, instead giving the electoral votes to Obama.  At the time, that decision made a lot of sense.  Wisconsin had voted Democratic in the last 4 presidential elections.  But considering the stumbling effort to recall Walker, Wisconsin may be in play for Romney as well.

If Obama looks to be on shaky footing in Wisconsin, we shouldn&#8217;t expect other states that Obama won by similar numbers in 2008 to be &#8216;safe&#8217; as well.  The prime example is Nevada.  Continued real-estate problems and a overall lackluster economy throw Nevada, which Obama won by 12.5% in 2008, solidly into the tossup column.

Obama&#8217;s overall winning margin in 2008 was 95 electoral votes, so he can afford to lose some of these states.  On the other hand, the fact that easy wins  in 2008 are now turning into swing states poses a hurdle for Obama&#8217;s campaign.  If states like Wisconsin are in play for Romney, Romney&#8217;s path to 270 electoral votes becomes a little more feasible.  Obama can&#8217;t be happy about that.
