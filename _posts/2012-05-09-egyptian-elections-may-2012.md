Ever since an [Arab Spring](http://rantaweek.com/the-middle-easts-future/ "The Middle East’s Future- October 30, 2011") Revolution deposed Egypt&#8217;s autocratic Hosni Mubarak last year, Egypt&#8217;s military has ruled during a transitional period.  Unfortunately, this transitional period has been a bumpy ride, and military leaders have been accused of holding too much power over the future of their country.  Nevertheless, as the ones orchestrating the upcoming presidential election, these generals need to be powerful enough to make the election successful.  This crucial balance of power has become increasingly more wobbly.

The first failing of the military transitional leadership is that they have waited this long to hold elections.  Mubarak was deposed well over a year ago, but the presidency has remained vacant.  An easy excuse for this stalling was that a rushed process would lead to a disorganized and possibly chaotic election season.  However, &#8216;chaotic&#8217; remains a good description for what is currently occurring in Egypt.

Protesters have returned to Tahrir Square, the main site of the anti-Mubarak protests last January, in order to call for more assurances of visible change.  The spark that ignited this recent anger was the army&#8217;s insistence that they will not cede power until after the presidential election.  Fears persist that, by not ceding power now, the generals will try to maintain their authority after the election by not giving full control to the newly elected president, whoever he is.

But while that fear only has a possibility of becoming true, a similar manifestation of the generals&#8217; power already occurred when the generals decided to bar various candidates from competing in the race.  Again, there are two sides to this issue.  The generals can claim that they are weeding the field of unsuitable candidates (including, believe it or not, Mubarak&#8217;s former vice-president) while others refute that the generals can abuse this power to remove candidates they dislike while taking away the final decision of who is or isn&#8217;t suitable from the voters.  Additionally, the recent violence this upcoming election has caused is prompting other candidates to drop out, narrowing the field even more.  The constantly changing field of presidential hopefuls adds an additional layer of complexity into the race.

And unfortunately, there is no promise that the violence will stop after elections are held later in May.  A runoff election is likely, and this runoff is not scheduled until June.  But as for right now, Egypt&#8217;s presidential election appears to be morphing from a democratic turning point into a violent mess.  Egypt has proven that creating a functioning democracy is much more difficult than merely deposing a dictator.  Power currently rests with military leaders, and it may take a great deal of work to wrest that power into the deserving hands of the Egyptian people.
