It has never been a secret that Iran and the United States have not gotten along. What with Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad openly flaunting his hatred of the United States, relations have always been heated. However, recently, relations between Iran and the United States, along with most of the rest of the western world, have started to become increasingly tense. These increased tensions started back in October of 2011, when an alleged plot came foward of an assasination on the Saudi ambassador in the U.S. It had failed of course, but the US and Saudi Arabia were both very upset about it and felt that it was a severe encroachment on their safety. Moreover, the US was even more scared because it was believed that Iran went through chanels in Mexican drug cartels and this may have been a sign of increasing Iranian influence in Latin America. This fear arises later, but we will get to that in Part 2.

Just several days after this alleged plot, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN&#8217;s atomic watchdog, released a report that claimed that Iran is researching a nuclear warhead and may likely get one within the next several years. This report affirmed the fears of many that Iran may have nukes. The US and many other western governments have applied sanctions on and off since 1979. However, the sanctions in response to Iran&#8217;s burgeoning nuclear programme began in 2006. Since then, sanctions have continued to pile on, but have had little effect. Until recently, sanctions on Iran had become a joking matter. With this report, the western world made an effort to stop this programme by further sanctioning Iran, once again to no avail.

Later in November, Iranian ties with the UK started to fray and eventually break. It started when a group ofÂ  students, as a youth wing of one of most powerful institutions in Iran, stormed the British embassy in Iran. Soon after, the UK withdrew all diplomats and expelled the Iranian diplomats in the UK. The breaking of these ties was a major step towards Iran&#8217;s further isolation. Many countries had already cut diplomatic ties with Iran, except at international meetings, and the UK was one of the last standing ties with a major western power. This entire incident, which only occured over the course of a few days, signified Iran&#8217;s almost complete isolation from the western world.

With these events, and a slew of Iranian nuclear scientists getting killed at various points in time, it seemed inevitable that Iran would ultimately go to war with the United States. While Iran might not directly attack the US, there was very strong indication that should Iran attack anyone, it would be Israel. And given the history of US-Israeli relations, should Israel get attacked by anyone, the US would be at it&#8217;s side attacking right back. The other situation that seemed likely was that Israel would attack Iran, and the US would again be at Israel&#8217;s side. Not only this, but Iran declared that should Israel attack, Iran would also consider it a declaration of war by the United States.

The last major event in Western-Iranian relations in 2011 was the Iranian capture of the American drone. At the beginning of December, an Iranian military official stated that the military had shot down a US spy drone along the eastern border of Iran that was supposedly infringing on Iranian airspace. After a few days, the United States finally officially recognized that they had lost a spy drone near the eastern border of Iran. With this recognition, President Obama formally asked for the drone back. However, his request was immediately shot down by the Iranian government, who asserted that it was in their airspace and is therefore their property. Rather, the government actually asked for the US to apologize for infringing on their airspace. This debate ultimately ended in Iran displaying the drone in a museum. In addition, an Iranian company is making minatures of the drone and has sent President Obama a minature pink plastic drone, almost as a slap in the face.

This has been Part 1 of the discussion of US-Iranian relations and their recent deterioration. Because of the complexity of this problem, this article will be broken up into two parts. Please come back in the next few days for Part 2!
