This past weekend, a movement called &#8220;Occupy Wall Street&#8221; has spread from Zucotti Park in New York to almost every other major city in the world, all under the name &#8220;Occupy [Insert City Here].&#8221; The movement has become so big, that it in fact has it&#8217;s <a href="http://peopleslibrary.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">own library</a>. But what is the goal of these protests?

The position is clear, yet the end goal is vague. They ask for an end to corporate greed, corruption, bailouts etc. The idea is that they are &#8220;The 99%&#8221; of people who hold so little of the wealth and are protesting against 1% of people who hold a majority of the wealth. This much is understandable, and something that I can get behind. However, the demands of this protest seem rather unclear. The protesters are obviously trying to obtain awareness, but beyond that, what do they want to do?

The awareness aspect is clear, and they have caught the attention of most of the news and have sent a clear message that those protesting are upset. They have even started a movement called <a href="http://occupygeorge.com/" target="_blank">Occupy George</a>, aimed at sending a message on dollar bills. With this, the Occupiers are making the general population aware of their woes, but is that all?

The other visible impact that the Occupiers may have is a political one, dependent on who they support.  This being said, their support may become important to Obama&#8217;s reelection chances.  As a president who is  trying to appeal to the middle class, he should try to gather the entire support of the Occupiers. More importantly, many are starting to call Occupy a counter-movement to the Tea Party and the first far-left movement in recent times. Equally important, many trade groups and unions, a population that is traditionally left-leaning and a huge support base for Democrats, are starting to back Occupy movements. With these trade groups, unions and far leftists starting to formally back the protesters , it is paramount to Obama&#8217;s reelection that he maintain the support of these groups. But doing so will be a large challenge because many Occupiers see Obama as a man who says he supports the middle class, but think his policy says otherwise. They argue that with Timothy Geithner heading the Treasury, and the multiple bailouts that Obama authorized, he is a Wall Street sympathizer. This view may be the political death of Obama, and unless he manipulates this view of him, he will be losing some of his strongest supporters.

In total, the Occupy protests seem to have very little of a direct impact. The goals of the Occupiers are very vague, with no clear path to acheiving these goals. However, they may still make some achievements simply by the fact that they represent a population that Obama is dependent on and therefore may require him to change his policy in order to gain their support. The impact and goals of the Occupy Library though? That is a whole different story. -MD
