Tuesday night probably felt like a minor miracle for Rick Santorum.  Polls in both Alabama and Mississippi forecast a third place finish for Mr. Santorum.  The race seemed to be more of a Romney-Gingrich tossup than anything else.

However, through a strong display of voter support, Santorum prevailed in both states, adding two more victories to his steadily growing list.  Since these were both &#8216;upset&#8217; victories, Santorum may expect to see positive momentum in new polls due to voters being less concerned about his campaign&#8217;s viability.  After all, an unexpected double win in states where both Romney and Gingrich seemed to be dominant proves that, at least for right now, Santorum is the man to beat.

Well&#8230; perhaps that is not quite true.  While Santorum&#8217;s victories in the South helped him to get some good press and strengthened his campaign&#8217;s appearance, last night was far from a victory.  Delegates are the ultimate determinant for who wins the nomination, and believe it or not, Romney garnered more delegates in the contests Tuesday night than Santorum.  While Santorum was celebrating his wins in Alabama and Mississippi, Romney picked up two wins for himself from the caucuses in Hawaii and American Samoa.  At the end of the night, Romney had won the plurality of delegates.

And yet Tuesday was not truly a win for Mr. Romney either.  Winning pluralities of delegates does not help him prove himself as a majority candidate.  This status is crucial because Romney must maintain the possession of a majority of delegates in order to prevent a brokered convention.  Right now, when adding up all of the delegates awarded from all of the states so far, Romney does have this majority.  However, it is a slim one, at about 53%.  Romney&#8217;s &#8216;front-runner&#8217; status runs into trouble when he can barely hold on to his majority and especially when he fails to win hotly contested states against a weaker opponent.

The next important clash between the two candidates will be in Illinois next Tuesday.  Romney&#8217;s Super-PAC is already dumping money into the state in an attempt to maintain Romney&#8217;s slim lead in the polls.  Still, Romney&#8217;s money advantage failed him in Alabama and Mississippi, and the effectiveness of his advertisements will be tested once again in Illinois.

Santorum made an embarrassing dent in Romney&#8217;s campaign, and another chance for Santorum to overcome a deficit in the polls and challenge Romney will present itself next week in Illinois.  As of right now, Romney still seems likely, but he is far from inevitable.
