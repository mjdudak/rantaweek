Marco Rubio has received a great deal of buzz both as a rising star of the G.O.P and as a possible VP pick.  Since Rubio is a Senator from Florida, many have prognosticated that his placement on Romney&#8217;s ticket would flip the crucial swing state red.

Reasonable logic? Yes.  A sound argument for why Rubio would make a good VP pick? Not at all.

The statistics behind my claim may sound confusing, but it all goes back to looking at the electoral map.  RantAWeek [examined the electoral college back in April](http://rantaweek.com/the-electoral-college-doing-the-math-april-27-2012/ "The Electoral College: Doing the Math"), and our basic conclusion was that Romney&#8217;s most likely shot at winning the presidential election involved him winning in both Florida and Ohio, two of the largest and most hotly contested swing states.  If Obama manages a victory in either, he will probably hit the threshold of 270 electoral votes and win re-election.

Romney needs both Florida and Ohio, but Rubio only helps with Florida.  Right now, it looks like Florida would be a slightly easier win for the Romney campaign than Ohio.  Instead of shooting for a win in Florida, Romney needs to aim for what would likely be a more difficult win in Ohio.  After all, just winning the easier battle in Florida does not give Romney the presidency.

Electorally, Ohio has a much greater chance than Florida to be the ultimate deciding state in the presidential election this year.  Sure, Rubio might win electoral votes for Romney in Florida, but those electoral votes would probably be meaningless if not matched with the more difficult win in Ohio.

Rubio has other reasons why he&#8217;s popular, but he should not be chosen as VP based solely off the reason that he is from a swing state.  If Romney is aiming for an electoral shake-up with his VP pick, he would be better off picking Senator Rob Portman from Ohio.

That being said, there are other qualities Romney will be looking for in his selection.  Rubio is still a contender, although Portman seems a better pick based off electoral predictions.  Still, assuming that one state is the key to an election is putting all of your electoral eggs in one basket.  Let&#8217;s widen our analysis; I am done with the &#8220;But Rubio&#8217;s from Florida!&#8221; argument.
