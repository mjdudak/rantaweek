The most exciting days of the election season are coming up, and RantAWeek is excited to cover these critical moments of the campaign.  To do so, we will be employing the same live blog approach used in the primaries.  As of right now, our Fall 2012 live blog schedule stands as such:

1. Domestic Policy Presidential Debate &#8211; October 3rd

2. Vice Presidential Debate &#8211; October 11th

3. Town Hall Style Presidential Debate &#8211; October 16th

4. Foreign Policy Presidential Debate &#8211; October 22nd

5. Election Night &#8211; November 6th

We implore you to save these dates and watch the RantAWeek live blogs!  To reminisce about the primaries, visit our [archived live blog page](http://rantaweek.com/live-blogs/ "Live Blogs").
