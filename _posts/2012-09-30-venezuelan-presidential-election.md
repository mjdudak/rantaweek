&#8220;Suddenly, With Chavez&#8221; is a Venezuelan radio show that can be aired at any time and last however long it wants.  The man behind this show is Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez, and his clever media manipulation is just another way that Chavez has become the dominant political force within his country.

First taking the presidency in 1999, Chavez has used much of the last 13 years to consolidate his own power while moving Venezuela towards leftist economic policies.  Chavez has also been a harsh critic of the United States and an ally to countries like Cuba and Iran.  But even though Venezuela and the U.S. have often clashed due to policy and ideological differences, Venezuela is a crucial exporter of oil for U.S. energy needs.  Likewise, Venezuela depends on oil revenues from the U.S. (in addition to countries like China) to power their economy.

In the past, Chavez has coasted to reelection without much opposition; he won the most recent 2006 election with close to 63% of the vote.  However, for this election season, the opposition has coalesced behind a more challenging opponent.  Leading the opposition to Chavez is Henrique Capriles, who won the opposition primary by a large margin and has proven himself to be a worthy campaigner.  Capriles, a former state governor, was already well known within his country and enjoys the support of many who have become disillusioned with Chavez.

Chavez is not used to facing such organized opposition, and the presidential election on October 7th is likely to be much closer than past elections.  Capriles, who wants to move Venezuela away from the socialist policies Chavez has championed, actually has a shot at winning.

Another problem Chavez faces deals not with the opposition but with himself.  Chavez has had a history of poor health, most notably having to undergo chemotherapy for cancer.  While he insists that he is cured, doubts still linger over his long term health and ability to lead the country if he falls ill again.  Capriles, on the other hand, is only 40 and presents himself as a more youthful leadership figure.

His weaknesses aside, Chavez has enjoyed the support of many poor Venezuelas who depend on his leftist policies for government support.  Even though he is now a controversial figure, he is still popular across many demographics.

Recent polls have shown a very close race between the two.  But while the race is close, it is important to remember that the ideologies are completely different.  Venezuela is facing a monumental decision that will dramatically affect the course it takes for the next six years.  Whatever the outcome, Venezuelans will be able to look back at this election as an important turning point.
