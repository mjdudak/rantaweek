Thanks to the folks at [Best Colleges Online](http://www.bestcollegesonline.com) for sharing this interesting infographic.  If you remember, we analyzed the youth vote not that long ago ourselves in [this article](http://rantaweek.com/youth-vote-april-25-2012/ "Obama’s Battle for the Youth Vote – April 25, 2012").  Hope you learn something!
