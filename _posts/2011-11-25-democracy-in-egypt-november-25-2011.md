We have [already discussed](http://rantaweek.com/the-middle-easts-future/ "The Middle East’s Future- October 30, 2011") the problems that face Egypt in its transition from authoritative regime to what Westerners hope will be a democracy.  However, with protesters riled up once more in the streets of Cairo, it&#8217;s time for an in-depth look of troubles in Egypt.

Protests started in Egypt this January, as social media spurred demonstrations in Cairo&#8217;s Tahrir Square.  These protests were inspired by the success of Tunisian efforts to replace their President Ben Ali.  Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, not wanting to simply give up power like Ali did in Tunisia, sent the Egyptian army to pacify the tens of thousands of protesters who refused to leave Tahrir Square.  Luckily, the army proved unwilling to forcibly remove the protesters, and some members of the army actually joined with the original protesters to call for Mubarak&#8217;s resignation.  Effectively powerless, Mubarak resigned mere weeks after the first protests started.  The Egyptian revolution was achieved with relatively little bloodshed.

Unfortunately, things weren&#8217;t over in Egypt.  The army stepped forward, saying that they would rule the country while it transitioned to a democracy.  Elections were planned, but then pushed back.  Military leaders worked to increase the army&#8217;s power and tried to increase their sway over the country&#8217;s future.  Fed up with a lack of change and unfulfilled promises of democracy, tens of thousands of Egyptians have returned to Tahrir Square and the streets of Cairo, pledging that they will not leave until their demands for a change in power are met.

The revolution has not been completed in Egypt, but it seems impossible for the army to remain in power indefinitely.  The people are already fed up, and it would be wise for the army to not try and grab too much power.  The Egyptian people have already proven that they will not tolerate any more abuses of their liberty.  It may the wisest decision for the army to actually facilitate the transition to a democracy to regain the confidence of the Egyptian people.

And when elections finally do come, the West must be ready to accept a government that is heavily dominated by Islamists.  The rise of political Islam after an Arab Spring revolution has already been in Tunisia.  A similar story is likely to unfold in Egypt.  It is a responsibility of the United States government to accept this choice of the Egyptian people and not condemn it.  The U.S. has limited friends in the Middle East, and it is important to count the new Egyptian government as an ally.  The birth of a new democracy should not be taken lightly, and the United States needs to increase its calls for a hastening of elections.

This is a crucial time for Egypt.  Its development into a democracy rests on both the actions of the military and the actions of the Egyptian people over the next few months.  Hopefully, the protests currently underway in Tahrir Square will transfer the message that the Egyptian people are done with military rule and want a full transition to democracy.  The Egyptian people have been hard at work  all year demanding a better future.  Let&#8217;s all hope they can see that dream become a reality.
