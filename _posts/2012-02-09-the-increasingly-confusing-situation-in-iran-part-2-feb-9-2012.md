We are back for Part 2 of delving into the relationship between the US and Iran. If you have not already, please read the [first post](http://rantaweek.com/the-increasingly-confusing-situation-in-iran-part-1-febuary-6th-2012/ "The Increasingly Confusing Situation in Iran (Part 1) – Febuary 6, 2012").

After the row with the drone, Iran started a line of flaunting it&#8217;s power. The first was that they vowed to stop the flow of oil through the important Straight of Hormuz should any foreign nations impose sanctions on it&#8217;s oil exports. This claim got one simple response from the US, a hard &#8220;no&#8221;. Soon after, Iran flaunted a medium range missile test that was successful. And this missile was pointed pretty much one place: Israel. So with Iran trying to control the Straight and this threat to Israel, already high tensions between the US and Iran grew higher, as Iran flaunted their power in the region.

Soon after this flaunt of power though, a sanction on Iran&#8217;s oil exports did not appear, but rather a full oil embargo on Iran by the European Union emerged in early January. This plan was not finalised at this time, but after several rounds of negotiations, the final plan emerged in late January. It declared that no new oil contracts are to be created and all existing deals would be allowed until July. This was a huge blow to the Iranian economy as it depends so heavily on oil. Moreover, the EU imports over 20% of Iran&#8217;s oil. This is such a sizeable portion that it has the greatest potential to damage Iran&#8217;s economy of any sanction or embargo applied up to this point. In addition to this, it is a very risky move by the EU as it could send prices rocketing when everything else in the economy is shaky and unstable. Fears were especially strong with regards to Greece. With such an economy, anything worse would hurt Greece. Greece is one of the largest Iranian oil importers in the EU and skyrocketing oil prices could be detrimental. However, the fact that the EU went foward with it regardless of economic worries demonstrates how insistent the EU was and how much most of the western world is trying to stop Iran&#8217;s nuclear programme.

But scarier yet to the United States was a threat closer to home by Iran, one that could come through channels of Latin American countries. In early January, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad made a tour around Latin America trying to raise support for his regime and support against the US. Ahmadinejad toured Venezuala, Nicaragua, Cuba, Ecuador and Guatemala. Through doing so, he arroused support against the US. Iran wants to gain more influence in Latin America because they view the US as the biggest threat to their nuclear programme. And as Iran sees their nuclear programme as their biggest and most important asset, they will do most anything to keep it intact. This tour spiked US fears that Iran can get close to us if they want to. This fear first came up with the assasination plot, but now with many governments siding with Iran, the fear grew.

Strewn in between this whole time has been the countless deaths of various nuclear scientists. No western country has admitted or said they have played any part in any  of these, but Iran begs to differ. Iran has been primarily blaming the US and UK, but has actually also blamed Israel for some. While the politics behind these are fairly simple, they simply create more seperation between the US and Iran. These supposed assasinations by the western world raise the already super high tensions and at this point in time, many are speculating that Iran is on a path to certain war with the US.

Since then, most of the news coming out of Iran has been that of more tension, more scientists killed and a weakening economy. For the first time, Iran is actually caring about the fact that these sanctions have been crippling the economy. This has been largely due to the fact that their currency has been in a consistent tailspin. With their economy in such a bad state, Iran is forced to pay attention to the pressure from other countries.

So with tensions being so high, and the US and Iran on a path to war, relations are not doing well. In the future, we can expect to see several rounds of negotiations regarding their nuclear programme that may bear fruit for the first time. The next few months in Iran will be crucial to whether or not a war with Iran will fill the void left by the US leaving Iraq. All diplomatic relations and negotiations, both by the US and other western countries, with Iran are crucial at this point. The situation will become even more confusing, but hopefully out of all of this, Iran will cede it&#8217;s nuclear programme, ultimately avoiding yet another war in the Middle East.
