With all of the attention  focused on Super Tuesday primaries this week, an important election slipped through the radar of discussion.  Vladimir Putin, the perennial Russian leader, was reelected on March 4th with almost 65% percent of the vote.  Unlike some of the hotly contested primary states, the outcome of the Russian election was obvious, and Putin was the only candidate who had enough strength to garner a majority.

This has been a recurring problem in Russia.  Putin and his political party, United Russia, have been in power so long that political opposition finds it difficult to make inroads.  While there were opposition candidates running against Putin, there has been no consolidation of anti-Putin sentiments into a specific political party.  Many claim that Russia under Putin is less of a democracy and more of a one-party state.  After all, no other presidential candidate was able to top even 20% of the vote.

Naturally, many Russians are upset about this.  Parliamentary elections held last December resulted in a [staggering loss](http://rantaweek.com/putins-problem-a-rumbling-russia/ "Putin’s Problem: A Rumbling Russia- December 9, 2011") for Putin&#8217;s United Russia.  The party was plagued by allegations that they had to commit fraud in order to maintain a slim majority.  An angry public took to the streets of Moscow in anti-Putin protests.

Here we must remember that Putin still maintains a great deal of support, as he was able to drown out the anti-Putin protests with a pro-Putin rally.  Putin&#8217;s mastering of the political sphere has helped him to quiet dissent, and the fact that he also controls the media has largely halted the spread of any anti-Putin sentiments.  However, for the presidential election, Putin tried to appease his critics who were accusing him of election fraud by having cameras watch over many voting locations for any misdeeds.

This gesture failed, as the election was still regarded as unfair, and more allegations of election fraud have surfaced.  People went back to the streets to protest against the unfairness.  However, little is expected to come of these new protests.  In no way will they prevent Putin from retaking the presidency and ruling Russia for the next six years.  And when elections come again in 2018, it would not be surprising to see Putin on the ballot once more.

At the end of the day, Russia is a cautionary tale.  More than twenty years after shifting away from Communist rule, the &#8216;democratic&#8217; society that the Russians tried to form is anything but.  Luckily, opposition is beginning to find ways to protest against the current leadership.  The main problem as of now is that opposition parties are separated by regional differences.  Still, as anger over the status quo of Putin increases, hopes rise that the opposition can find a way to coalesce and thus grow stronger on a national level.  Russians need a true choice when they vote, and a stronger opposition coupled with more stringent checks against election fraud can finally bring true democracy to Russia.
