Last July, in a rather controversial decision, Christine Lagarde was appointed as the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The controversy surrounding her appointment was primarily because with it, the IMF continued to be a primarily Eurocentric institution. Many had hoped that a financial leader from the developing world, namely Mexican economist Agustin Carstens, would be appointed, and become the first non-European to hold that post. Carstens was supported by the Latin American governments, Spain, Canada and Australia. And despite Carstens being arguably more well qualified for the position, Lagarde was appointing. In doing so, the IMF signalled that they would continue to focus on Europe, and leave the developing world largely to the wayside. Yet with this move, coupled with their failure to alleviate the global recession up to this point, many are questioning the place the IMF should play in the modern global economic order.

The primary reason the IMF&#8217;s role is being questioned is because of failure in the Eurozone. One of the IMF&#8217;s key purposes is to promote stability in the international economy, and does so largely by handing out large loans to floundering nations. However, the catch is that in order to get a loan from the IMF a nation must install strict austerity, raising taxes and slashing spending. And while often times, this ensures that the IMF gets their money back and that the the country reduces their debt, many consider the IMF&#8217;s approach to be stifling to economies trying to recover.. Those who take the approach of John Maynard Keynes would argue that in times of recession, governments must build up large debts and deficits in order to spend and get the economy kickstarted. The IMF however prevents any nations which get loans from doing so. In terms of the Eurozone debt crisis, the IMF has loaned large sums of money to suffering countries, primarily Greece. Yet the approach of constant austerity may not be the [right direction to go with the Eurozone](http://rantaweek.com/opinion-why-cant-the-eurozone-be-friends/ "Opinion: Why Canâ€™t the Eurozone Be Friends?"). So the IMF has been loaning out large sums of money, but the restrictions they impose in doing so may be stifling economic growth, This is one of the largest criticisms of the IMF and one of the largest reasons their necessity in the world is questioned.

The other primary reason that the IMF may no longer have a place in the world is because they have seemingly abandoned the developing world. In addition to helping developing nations with loans, the IMF is supposed to help promote economic stability in developing nations and drive down poverty. But with their focus on the Eurozone, the IMF has done no good for developing nations. In fact, the IMF has actually started to collect more money from each member. While this increase will impact the larger nations, it will have a much larger impact on developing nations. With enough to worry about, the IMF is simply piling on concern to the developing world.

The IMF has seemingly failed recently, both in the Eurozone and by abandoning the developing world. Yet the IMF can turn things around. First they should select a Managing Director who represents a large selection of nations that may very well be the economic engine to get us out of this recession. Then, ditch the forced austerity, and allow nations to get their economies back on their feet before they worry about getting down their debt. If the IMF can do so, they will re-establish themselves as an institution which is both necessary and beneficial for global economic stability.
