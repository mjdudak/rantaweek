With less than two months left until the first results come in for the 2012 Republican nomination, the race is beginning to heat up.  The top five candidates have made [a lot of news](http://rantaweek.com/the-great-republican-race/ "The Great Republican Race- October 7, 2011") lately, but what does all this news mean for their chances of winning?

Currently polling in fifth place at 8% is Ron Paul, who has struggled to receive media attention. However, his largest problem is that, while he is extremely popular amongst heavily Libertarian Republicans, his views often alienate the majority of the Republican base.  For this reason, Ron Paul has had fairly consistent poll numbers but should not expect to see a much-needed outburst of support.  He represents a passionate sect of the Republican party, but is ultimately unable to represent the party as a whole.

In fourth, with 11% support, is Rick Perry.  After shooting to the top of the polls in October, Rick Perry has seen his support quickly fade after a series of disappointing debate performances.  His recent blunder of failing to remember the third government department that he would shut down as president only decreased his viability as a candidate.  This blunder has received significant media attention, and countless people who never saw the original debate now know that Rick Perry forgot an important pillar of his platform.  Perry has turned from a front runner into the butt of political jokes, with a long path to travel back to the top of the polls.  Still, it should be noted that Perry&#8217;s fundraising potential still leaves him some money to work with.

With 12% support and in third place, Newt Gingrich also deserves a mention. His popularity has been increasing in recent weeks, and many have started to see him as a serious contender. However, his problem lies in the fact that he has not held any important political office since resigning as Speaker of the House in 1999.  He was brought down by a wave of disapproval then, and increased media attention created by any rise in the polls may only serve to remind Republicans of his past issues. Newt Gingrich will have to adapt to the new century if he hopes to continue to gain momentum.

With 21% is Herman Cain, who emerged from obscurity to take his place amongst the leaders just last month. Many Republicans are enamored by his 9-9-9 tax plan and its goal to simplify the tax code.  As many voters place economic issues at the forefront of their concerns, campaigning on a mostly economic platform has helped Cain receive attention for his 9-9-9 plan while avoiding difficult topics in other areas such as foreign policy and international relations.  On the other hand, attention may be the opposite of what Cain has been looking for.  Allegations that Cain has sexually assaulted multiple women have surfaced and forced Cain into a frenzy of bad press.  This has, surprisingly, not affected Cain too harshly in the polls.  However, as more details come to light, the bad press may start to drag his poll numbers down.  Professing his innocence, Mr. Cain has tried to divert attention to other issues.  At the most recent debate, he succeeded fairly well in doing so, leaving him in the best position to upset front runner Mitt Romney.

Also polling at 21%, Mitt Romney has remained his status as a front runner while other candidates have risen and failed.  His strengths lie in his debate performances and his ability to avoid bad press.  As a runner-up to the Republican nomination in 2008, Romney already has made some connections with the Republicans he must persuade to vote for him.  Romney, however, is less of the stereotypical Republican and more of a moderate.  This could actually help his campaign attract moderates during the general election.  Unfortunately for him, his moderate stances could set him apart from the overall Republican base, making a primary win difficult.  Romney&#8217;s larger problem is that, while he has maintained his position as a front runner and has the strongest fundraising out of any candidate, no one is particularly excited about his run.  Still, his strong polling numbers give Romney the best chance at becoming the Republican candidate if only he can find a way to garner more support from his Republican base.
