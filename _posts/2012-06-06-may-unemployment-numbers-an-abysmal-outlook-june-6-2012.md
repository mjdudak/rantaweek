Earlier this week, the employment numbers came out for the month of May. The results were rather abysmal. The amount of jobs gained in March-May was under half of the jobs created from December-February. For the first time since June of 2011, the unemployment rate actually went up, from 8.1% to 8.2%. While numbers are great, what does it all mean?

Well for one, from a purely economic stand point, it means that the economy, which long looked to be recovering, slowly for sure, but recovering nonetheless, has seemingly stalled. However when delving deeper at actual economic events it seems as if the reason the economy has stalled is due to worldwide economic issues. Ranging from [Europe&#8217;s](http://rantaweek.com/eurozone-debt-crisis-2012/ "Eurozone Debt Crisis – April 18, 2012") [many](http://rantaweek.com/greeces-failing-economy-january-17-2012/ "Greece’s Failing Economy – January 17, 2012") [problems,](http://rantaweek.com/the-new-european-economy-november-30-2011/ "The New European Economy- November 30, 2011") to China and India&#8217;s stalled growth, the US cannot be solely to blame for these awful numbers. These  worldwide problems send a ripple affect throughout the rest of the economy, impacting even US jobs. In short, the US is not necessarily doing much wrong. While there is for sure some more policy that can be implemented to fix the economy, growth also depends on other economies to get back on track. The US cannot by any means sit back and blame others, but they must consider economic collaboration with the rest of the world, ensuring that the world as a whole comes out of recession.

That being said, with the presidential election in the back of everyone&#8217;s mind, the impact of these numbers becomes very political. Any important issue is now a presidential issue. So first, how this impacts Obama. Because Obama is the incumbent, anything that goes on currently will be seen as something that is a cause of Obama&#8217;s policy. Therefore, Republicans are of course blaming these abysmal jobs number son Obama. In fact, a slowly growing recovering economy was one of the biggest advantages that Obama had going for him.

So with Obama being blamed for these numbers, how are Obama and his Democratic responding? Alan Krueger, the Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors has stated that Obama&#8217;s policies will work, they simply need more time to work. While this argument may be true, Obama only has six more months before he faces reelection. If his policies do not take place and drop the unemployment rates by then, he will be seen as doing very little for the economy. Romney will simply claim that [Bain Capital](http://rantaweek.com/bain-of-romneys-campaign-may-30/ "The ‘Bain’ of Romney’s Candidacy – May 30, 2012") is a job creator, therefore giving him the right experience, while Obama has not made the government effective at creating jobs. Yet the flaw in that logic is that Romney does not actually want Obama to use government money to create jobs.

In the end, the politics of this poor job reports will most likely impact Obama negatively. Most voters will simply see that under Obama&#8217;s administration, unemployment has gone up mostly, and dropped only a bit. The current unemployment rate is higher than when Obama entered the office. However, blaming Obama for this is largely inaccurate. He not only inherited a bad US economy, he also has to deal with the rest of the world&#8217;s economy going down the drain. Finally, Obama has also had to deal with a virtually stagnant legislature, one where all policies get caught up in the recent rise of extreme partisanship. The unemployment numbers spell doom economically and politically for all involved. The US needs to stop pointing fingers and work to improve the domestic and international economy. It cannot afford another jobs report that is this poor.
