When July jobs numbers were published, the report was far from straightforward.  163,000 jobs were added, a number far better than any other monthly gain this summer.  However, the unemployment rate increased to 8.3%.

The numbers underline the fact that even with increased hiring, America&#8217;s unemployment crisis is far from resolution.  Even though the unemployment rate has fallen from a high of 10% in 2009, much of the drop can be attributed to discouraged workers giving up on their job search as well as workers accepting part time jobs when they want full time work.  The commonly cited unemployment rate does not include these categories, but with their inclusion, the unemployment rate would jump to 15%.

Stubbornly high unemployment creates a search for solutions.  Naturally, politicians have jumped on the issue, citing various reasons for America&#8217;s employment woes and presenting voters with the corresponding solutions.  The big accomplishment by Congress so far has been the passage of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, which was designed to ease regulations on small but growing businesses.

The JOBS Act is a good start, but a mere easing of regulations is not a panacea.  Unfortunately, more powerful bills that deserved bipartisan support have instead been ripped apart by partisan gridlock.  Congress has the small solutions down, but fails to agree on the big ones.

The best example to explain this deals with outsourcing, which has caused millions of American jobs to be sent overseas.  Democrats proposed a bill that would give tax cuts to companies that brought these foreign jobs back to America.  This &#8216;insourcing&#8217; bill utilized tax cuts as an incentive, a strategy Republicans have touted as a strong solution to unemployment woes.  The bill seemed ready to receive bipartisan support and easy passage.

However, any hopes for bipartisan approval quickly came crashing down.  Spurred by Republican attempts to amend the bill with a repeal of Obamacare, Democrats decided to block all Republican amendments.  Angered that Democrats were refusing any amendments whatsoever from the minority party, Republicans refused to pass the bill.

But outsourcing is not the only issue Congress has failed to adequately address.  Another large-scale problem known as &#8216;hollowing out&#8217; remains mostly unchecked.  &#8216;Hollowing out&#8217; occurs when companies, faced with economic difficulties, lay off mid-income workers.  High-income workers in crucial management positions in addition to low-income workers who provide cheaper labor are excepted to assume the responsibilities of the fired workers.  Even when the economy picks back up and hiring resumes, these middle class workers find that the nature of their old positions have changed to the point where there is no longer a need for their skills.

The current recovery has demonstrated that companies can return to former profits without rehiring fired workers.  While this means that overall economic growth has continued, this growth is not coupled with a drastic reduction in unemployment.

Fixing this problem of a hollowed out job market is not easy, as there is no simple solution to making middle class jobs crucial to businesses.  Tax cuts may persuade companies to hire, but a true fix to hollowing out would also require a difficult restructuring of positions within these hiring companies.  While politicians have often lamented this shrinking of the middle class, their attempts to solve the underlying problems have been inefficient or nonexistent.

Many employment problems have not yet been adequately addressed.  However, for a true economic recovery, government should do more to solve the big problems, and finally get people back to work.
