When most people think of terrorist hotspots, they (with arguable veracity) think of the rugged, mountainous regions of Afghanistan and Pakistan.  However, a new threat emerged earlier this year, when forces connected to Islamist militants seized control of the northern half of the African nation of Mali.  This in itself was troubling, but the United States and allies were even more troubled about the fact that some of these militant groups now controlling northern Mali have been linked with al-Qaeda.

It&#8217;s all part of a growing trend that is forcing us to change our counter-terrorism efforts.  While the United States and allies have cracked down on terrorism in its more traditional areas, the terrorists have simply been able to move to new locales.  For this reason, nascent al-Qaeda related organizations have popped up in [Syria](http://rantaweek.com/al-qaeda-in-syria-a-dangerous-development/ "Al-Qaeda in Syria, A Dangerous Development") and [Yemen](http://rantaweek.com/problems-pakistan-yemen/ "Problems in Pakistan and Yemen"), not just Mali.

There&#8217;s a common thread evident within all three of those countries: political instability.  Yemen&#8217;s weak central government was further weakened when former President Ali Saleh was forced out of power as a consequence of the Arab Spring.  Syria&#8217;s civil war has prompted some militias to move towards extremism.  In Mali, political unrest following a coup led to a period of weak central governance in which the al-Qaeda affiliated terrorists were able to seize control of northern Mali.

What we&#8217;re witnessing is a dispersion of extremism.  This can be viewed in both a positive and a negative light.  Looking at the glass half full, al-Qaeda no longer has a concentration of power but now must deal with being scattered across many countries and a wide geographic area.  On the flipside, more countries with an extremist presence makes individual terrorist groups and organizations more difficult both to monitor and to counter.

Both the optimistic and the pessimistic sides of the argument can be logically explained, but perhaps the best explanation takes a middling stance.  This explanation is that we are simply entering a new and different stage of our counter-terrorism efforts, a fact also demonstrated by the planned withdrawal from Afghanistan.  However, just because the U.S. and NATO allies plan to withdraw from Afghanistan does not mean we have rescinded our interests in the region.  In fact, the opposite is true.  Hillary Clinton has recently met with the leader of Algeria, a nation that borders the section of Mali under extremist control.  The purpose of the meeting was to discuss possible plans for forcing the militants out of power.

Of course, the United States does not want to militarily intervene itself.  After all, more than a decade of heavy military involvement in the Middle East has prompted the United States to be more hesitant about future operations.  More likely than direct U.S. military involvement is a situation similar to what has occurred in Somalia, another African nation that has been partially controlled by an al-Qaeda affiliated group.  In Somalia, troops led by the African Union liberated the capital and restored order.  This operation was followed by troops from neighboring Kenya and Ethiopia working to regain control of other regions of the country.

Extremist threats within Somalia remain, but the strong influence that neighboring nations had in helping regain some order in Somalia is why the U.S. is so interested in partnering with Algeria.  There are mutual interests in finding a solution that will force the militants out of power in Mali.   Hopefully, we can learn from past experiences to not only counter extremism in Mali, but also to apply those tactics to the new stage of our counter-terrorism efforts.
