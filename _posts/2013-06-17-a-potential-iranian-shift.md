For the past few years, Iran has been controlled by a hard-line, conservative government that has escalated not only Iran&#8217;s nuclear program but also tensions with other countries.  As such, many found it to be quite a relief when Iran&#8217;s recent presidential election was won not by a ultra-conservative but by Hassan Rouhani, who campaigned as a moderate.

At first, Rouhani&#8217;s more moderate stances would seem to signal an imminent change in Iran&#8217;s relations with the rest of the world, hopefully changing relations from standoffish to conciliatory.  After all, part of Rouhani&#8217;s platform was to appease the international community in exchange for an end to the sanctions that have crippled Iran&#8217;s economy.  Unfortunately, investigating the election more closely leads to the realization that change might not be as rapid or as forceful as many Western nations would like.

The first hurdle to a shift in Iran&#8217;s policies and foreign relations is its governmental structure.  Rouhani, as president, will only have a small slice of power in the Iranian government.  More powerful than the office of the presidency is the office of Supreme Leader, a lifetime position held by Ayatollah Ali Kahmenei.  Even if Rouhani attempts a shift to more moderate policies, Kahmenei, a strict conservative hardliner, will likely be able to resist most changes.

The second hurdle is Rouhani himself.  While Rouhani was endorsed by the reformist movement and widely viewed as a moderate candidate, he is also a cleric, meaning that his election actually enhances the theocratic aspects of the Iranian government.  Considering that some reformers want to steer Iran away from its Islamic system of governance, it seems odd that the reform movement would back a cleric&#8217;s campaign, especially after eight years of having a secular president.

Indeed, the perception of Rouhani as strongly connected with the goals of Iran&#8217;s reform movement is seriously flawed.  While Rouhani did receive the support of Iran&#8217;s reform movement, the support was far from enthusiastic.  He was only officially backed by the reform movement two days before the election.  Rouhani&#8217;s position as the reformists&#8217; candidate was more or less crafted for support in the days leading up to the election, and some aspects of his political history actually show him supporting _anti-_reform policies.

Still, completely writing off a move towards the center is flawed thinking.  Rouhani garnered more than twice as many votes as his nearest opponent, signaling a clear public referendum against the current conservative orthodoxy and showing public opinion favors more moderate options.  And while Rouhani may not be the dream reformist candidate, he does represent some change from the hard-line conservative thinking of the past decade.  Rapid change is unlikely, but public pressure for change, especially amid a devastated economy, may start to sway Iranian policies.
