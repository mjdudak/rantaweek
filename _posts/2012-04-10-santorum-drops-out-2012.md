Before the primaries and caucuses even began, there was &#8216;probable cause&#8217; to call Mitt Romney the inevitable Republican candidate.  However, during a long campaign that included noticeable losses in Iowa, Tennessee, Alabama, and Mississippi, the evidence at times seemed to be merely circumstantial.  But since Rick Santorum has announced that he is ending his bid for president, it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that Mitt Romney will win the Republican nomination.  Even though Mitt Romney does not yet have all the needed delegates to secure the nomination, his opponents lack any feasible means to prevent him from acquiring the rest that he needs.  It is now safe to call a wrap on this primary and officially move the focus to the general election.

Still, the primary season has left scars on Mr. Romney.  Even though he was able to outspend Santorum by large margins in key states, Romney had difficulty combating Santorum&#8217;s grassroots-based support.  The underlying theme from the primaries is that people are in no way ecstatic about Mitt Romney.  Even after the math showed Romney to have a clear delegate advantage that would likely carry him to the nomination, he still waged a relatively close battle with Santorum in Wisconsin.  The support Romney has gained in recent weeks has not been from a consensus that he is the best candidate but instead from a consensus that he is the most electable.  Romney&#8217;s victory involved outlasting his opponents through a process of elimination, not from being the outright most popular candidate.

Romney also suffered some demographics issues.  He did not poll strongly among blue-collar workers, and Romney&#8217;s supporters tended to be more well-off than those of Santorum.  Romney will have to undo his &#8216;rich guy&#8217; image in order to better connect to everyday Americans.  Unfortunately, a series of gaffes during the primary season have etched this elitist image into his public perception.  Most memorably, Romney&#8217;s release of his tax returns quantified his wealth, showing a large gap between him and most prospective voters.

Even though the length of the primaries caused Romney to divert his attention from competing against President Obama and challenge members of his own party, the primary season was not all bad news for him.  Firstly, he managed to out-fundraise the other candidates by staggering margins, showing that his fundraising abilities may be able to match those of Obama.  The amount of money a candidate has to spend on advertisements can make or break a campaign.  In addition, Romney showed great strength in the state of Florida, a crucial electoral state that he won easily.  If Romney can show similar strength in November, President Obama will have a difficult time winning the 29 electoral votes the state doles out.

But we should not only analyze Romney&#8217;s future, as it is also important to think about Santorum&#8217;s path forward.  RantAWeek has [previously concluded](http://rantaweek.com/rick-santorum-looking-ahead/ "Rick Santorum: Looking Ahead – March 29, 2012") that it is a smart political move for Santorum to make peace with Romney by not extending his campaign to the convention.  This way, he may expect to receive some position in a possible Romney administration.  For Romney, having Santorum on his side may be crucial in attempting a win in Pennsylvania, another heavily populated state that could help him in the Electoral College.  Santorum&#8217;s campaign is over, but his campaigning (this time for Romney) may not be.

Mitt Romney has successfully outlasted his opponents to become the nominee.  Now we will see what he can do with this opportunity.
