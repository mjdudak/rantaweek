Throughout the summer, news relating to the presidential election has been scarce.  The two biggest stories of late have been [Romney&#8217;s disappointing trip abroad](http://rantaweek.com/north-korea-soccer/ "Romney’s World Tour, Complete With Gaffes") and speculation over the Vice Presidential pick.  However, this news is far from game-changing.  Romney&#8217;s foreign exploits will be largely forgotten by November, and &#8216;Veepstakes&#8217; is mainly an opportunity for pundits.  Sure, the VP pick will be an important factor in determining the outcome of the election, but mere speculation is unlikely to have any lasting impact on the polls.

So, election news is slow.  But slow news is not an electoral wash.  Most polls show Obama with a slight advantage, forcing Romney to play a game of catch-up.  However, as a dearth of news prevents Romney from gaining positive momentum, he has less and less time to improve his standing in the polls.

Still, just because Obama is the current favorite does not guarantee him a victory in November.  Even though Romney is now faced with a slow news cycle, that will change in the coming weeks.  When he does make his VP announcement, the ensuing media focus on his campaign will have the possibility of boosting his popularity.  In addition, the Republican convention will highlight key issues and intrigue voters in a way that the Democratic Convention is unlikely to.  After all, after having the presidency for four years, Obama&#8217;s positions are well known.  Romney has been coy on many issues, meaning that many curious voters will be watching the Republican convention to see what new ideas the opposition party has.

The Republican Convention also helps Romney in a way that is totally unrelated to the news cycle.  The Convention will officially delegate him as the G.O.P&#8217;s candidate, finally allowing him to tap into previously barred fundraising revenue.  Up until now, Romney has not been allowed to use money raised for the general election.  However, after gaining an official candidate status, he will be able to utilize his saved up resources to counter Obama in advertisements.  Considering that Romney has been more successful so far in raising money for the election than Obama, Romney should be able to more effectively use advertisements to target his message to voters.  For Obama, this will make the post-Convention campaign much more difficult than what he has experienced so far.  For Romney, this will be an opportunity to play catch-up.

The slow news cycle has been allowing Obama to idle in his favorable position, but plenty of election news is to come in the next few weeks.  Some of this news is likely to help Romney, making it imperative that Obama remains vigilant.  There is still plenty of time left for game-changing news to come.
