Recently, under the regime of President Thein Sein, Myanmar has been experiencing [democratic reform](http://rantaweek.com/change-in-myanmar-perhaps-january-19-2012/ "Change in Myanmar, Perhaps â€“ January 19, 2012"), and the National League for Democracy (NLD), the primary opposition party in Myanmar, experienced great success in the recent by-elections of 45 parliamentary seats. The 45 seats represent a very minuscule portion of the 650-seat parliament, but they are representative of future successes. This election is considered by many to be historic because it is the first time the NLD has been allowed to run since 1989. Aung San Suu Kyi, the General Secretary of the NLD, was up for one of the seats. She won it with an overwhelming majority. Of the 45 seats up for election, the NLD won 43. It was not registered in one constituency and the candidate in another was disqualified. So for all the seats that the NLD contested, it won. But what does this truly mean for democracy in Burma?

To many onlookers, this is indicative of increased democracy in Myanmar, and they would be right. Myanmar was ruled by a select group of military leaders, known as a junta, until last year. Since then, Sein has made a great effort to push forward democracy. While the 45 seats represent a small victory, in reality the NLD is expected to be popular enough to win a majority in the general elections in 2015, as well as possibly have Suu Kyi as president. Most democracies in the world are starting to lift sanctions on Myanmar and allow it more freedom in trade. Many leaders, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have hailed these reforms as a step on the way to democracy. There is no doubting that should the path Thein Sein has laid out continue, Myanmar will become a strong, prospering democracy. However, many of these sanctions being lifted may be premature.

The reasoning behind these skeptics is actually fairly sound. The primary reason is that Thein Sein will be forced to roll back his reforms. Even though the NLD won all the seats this month, they still are far from a majority. The Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDP) of Sein still holds such a large majority in the Parliament that they can do what they wish. Additionally, a quarter of the seats in the parliament are constitutionally required to be kept to the military leaders. These leaders are, and will likely remain to be pro-USDP. This means that if the USDP and military leaders (essentially the same group of people) start to feel threatened by the NLD, they will force Sein to roll back some of the reforms that have been promised. Additionally, the NLD runs the risk of being popular only because of Aung San Suu Kyi. Since she is 67, her active role in politics may be lessening as time goes on. By 2015, the general election, she will be 70 and may not be able to carry the entire party, and opposition, on her shoulders.

Since there is a chance that the victory tunes are premature, why are many international bodies rolling back sanctions and tightening ties? The answer to that question simply lies in incentive. Myanmar is rich with natural resources, but with the sanctions in place, economies are unable to utilize those resources. In tight economic times, moving in and swooping up natural resources is beneficial to all. To a lesser extent, many are also weary of the regime and in need of the reform to go well.

So while there is plenty of reason to be optimistic in Myanmar, it is imperative to not be too optimistic yet. Things are heading in the right direction, but the risk of reforms being rolled back is incredibly high and opposition runs the risk of dying with Suu Kyi&#8217;s political career. The international community and the Burmese must be cautiously optimistic in looking at the current situation.
