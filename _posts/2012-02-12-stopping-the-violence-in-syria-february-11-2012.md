(Update November 2012: This article details Syrian problems in general.  You can also read about [Russian arms](http://rantaweek.com/russia-and-syria-june-13-2012/ "Russia and Syria – June 13, 2012") and [al-Qaeda&#8217;s influence](http://rantaweek.com/al-qaeda-in-syria-a-dangerous-development/ "Al-Qaeda in Syria, A Dangerous Development") in Syria)

When the Arab Spring descended upon Syria, the hope was that protesters could rid themselves of their despotic leader Bashar al-Assad with as little bloodshed as possible.  Unfortunately, the situation in Syria has been rapidly deteriorating, and the nation has fallen into a civil war.  Assad had been using the army to forcefully quell protests against his rule.  However, many in the army refused to turn on their fellow citizens, and desertions from the army&#8217;s ranks helped grow the numbers of rebels who now are trying to depose Assad.  In spite of this, Assad still has the majority of the army on his side, and he has been using it to wreak destruction among his people.  Thousands have already died.

The international community has stayed short of any military intervention, citing that the no-fly zone used in Libya would not be worth its while in Syria.  But many nations still want to do something, and a condemnation of Assad&#8217;s regime was proposed in the U.N.  Shockingly, both China and Russia vetoed the action.  Not wanting to experience a bloody civil war in the region, the Arab League decided to press the U.N. further, and they convinced the United Nations Security Council to send a peacekeeping force into Syria to help calm the violence and negotiate a [ceasefire](http://rantaweek.com/syria-ceasefire-april-12-2012/ "Syria Ceasefire- April 12, 2012").  Of course, ceasefires are more easily proposed then enacted, and all attempts at creating a ceasefire have failed in the long run.

Economic sanctions have already been enacted by the Arab League and many other countries, but these attempts at undermining Assad&#8217;s government have amounted to little success.  Still, the general trend has been that more is being planned as more entities come together.

That last point is an important one.  While Russia refused to allow foreign intervention within Syria by use of their veto, a meeting with President Obama on the subject at least shows a dialogue has been started .  In addition, the cohesion that the Arab League has shown throughout their dealings with Syria demonstrates the growing effectiveness of that body.  Also important to note is that Assad seems to be running out of friends.  Iran, an important ally to Syria, is experiencing severe economic upheaval due to Western sanctions.  The Iranians barely have the money to keep themselves afloat, and it has become much more difficult for them to provide aid for Assad.

This does not mean that Assad is finished; he is in fact far from losing his power.  As long as he can keep control of the military, he can maintain his safety and stop rebels from gaining power.  Strengthening his position is the fact that members of the international community will be wary of invading Syria with the aim of ultimately removing Assad.  After all, the cautionary tale of Iraq shows that this path is a dangerous and costly one to follow.

The international community has a decision to make regarding Syria.  While it was first hesitant to intervene, an increased role by the U.N. has spurred hope that there are paths to restore stability and end slaughter.  The fate of the Syrian people rests in the balance, but the path forward is not yet clear.  The international community must find a way to prevent Assad from dragging Syria into a civil war while working to stay out of any violence themselves.
