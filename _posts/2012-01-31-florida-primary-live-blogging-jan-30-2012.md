We at RantAWeek are proud to announce that today, starting at 7 p.m. ET, will be trying out a live blog of the Florida Primary as results start coming in. It will be on [this page](http://rantaweek.com/florida-live-blog/ "Florida Primary Live Blog"). We hope that you will join us at that time and watch our coverage. Since this is our first time trying this, it will likely just be TM and MD, however in the future we will try to get some new voices in our live blogs, and might even get some new voices in today. Please give us any input as to what you think of our live blog, either by commenting here, on the live blog itself, or sending us an email. Enjoy!
