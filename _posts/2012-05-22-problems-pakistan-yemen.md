The [NATO summit](http://rantaweek.com/summit-week-may-20-2012/ "Summit Week: G-8 and NATO – May 20, 2012") earlier this week left a pretty good impression of the [exit strategy](http://rantaweek.com/afghan-pullout-april-15-2012/ "Leaving Afghanistan – April 15, 2012") world leaders have for the War in Afghanistan.  However, the summit failed on two notable counts: improving the relationship with Pakistan and furthering counter-terrorism efforts within Yemen.

First, Pakistan.  Relations deteriorated last year when SEAL Team Six assassinated Osama bin-Laden well inside Pakistan&#8217;s borders and without informing the Pakistani military.  However, tensions increased dramatically last November when an skirmish with U.S.-led NATO forces left 24 Pakistani soldiers dead.  Both the provocation for the attack and the instigating party are still disputed, but national anger in Pakistan prompted leaders to cut off a vital NATO supply line.

Relations have hardly cooled down since then.  The main reason is that the U.S. has continued its drone strikes in Pakistani airspace, an act that Pakistan views as an infringement of its sovereignty.  Still, many were optimistic when Pakistan&#8217;s president Asif Ali Zardari agreed to come to the NATO summit, especially considering Pakistan is not a NATO member.

Unfortunately, even though Zardari did come as planned to the summit, no deal was worked out.  President Obama said in his post-summit comments that he had not expected a deal to occur during the summit, and that further negotiations would have to be pursued in order to finally reach a compromise and reopen the supply route.

Even though this deal was apparently not expected, the fact that Zardari made the trip demonstrated that an agreement certainly was a possibility.  Additionally, the fact that the U.S. has maintained so shaky of relations with one of its crucial allies and has been unable to repair the situation for months emphasizes the difficulties the U.S. will continue to have within the Middle East.

Those difficulties within the Middle East also apply to Yemen.  While diplomacy is the main problem with Pakistan, issues with Yemen are more focused on combating terrorism.  But unlike the stagnant situation in Pakistan, the situation in Yemen is deteriorating.

Yemen, after an Arab Spring revolution that removed the president from office but only ended with his vice president taking power, is in a precarious political position.  The weakness of the central government has led to increased strength of the tribes that control and influence various regions of Yemen.  This has created fears that a nascent branch of al-Qaeda within the country can use the lack of federal oversight, coupled with the strong tribal culture, to create a dangerous terrorist network.

These fears were exacerbated by a terrorist bombing attack on Monday that killed nearly 100 Yemeni soldiers in the capital of Sana&#8217;a.  The fact that such an attack was able to occur within walking distance of the presidential palace demonstrates the relative strength of al-Qaeda compared to the Yemeni government.

While America has helped Yemen through the use of drone strikes, the NATO summit failed to adequately address the issues Yemen presents.  However, if al-Qaeda continues to grow its strength in Yemen, the threat will need to be discussed more completely at a future NATO summit or by the individual leaders within their own countries.  Al-Qaeda&#8217;s diversification outside of the nations it is usually associated with is a risk that organizations like NATO cannot ignore.  Successfully stopping extremism in nations like Afghanistan accomplishes little if extremism is allowed to grow unchecked in other nations.

As NATO winds down its role in Afghanistan, its job on the world stage is far from being over.  NATO countries, especially the U.S., must focus on improving relations with Pakistan.  In addition, the growing threat of al-Qaeda in Yemen means that more attention must be paid to its problems, and that a clear path forward must be made.
