The Korean War has long been considered more apt for history books than for newspapers.  But strangely enough, that viewpoint is not shared by North Korea, which recently nullified the armistice that ended the Korean War back in 1953.  And while North Korea often acts belligerently, it seems to be stepping up its rhetoric against not only South Korea but also against the United States.

North Korea claims its recent martial actions, including the movement of a missile to its coast and direct military threats against the U.S., were instigated by joint U.S.-South Korean military operations that took place last month.  However, this statement should not be trusted, as the United States military commonly works alongside South Korea without receiving such an inflammatory response from the North.  After all, the U.S. has kept tens of thousands of troops in South Korea for years, and North Korea has rarely protested in such a threatening way.

Why then is North Korea increasing the scope of its military endeavors?  The answer appears to not involve international disputes but instead is focused on domestic politics.  North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un might not need to worry about elections, but he is still a young leader with a great deal to prove to his people.  Navigating the country through a crisis &#8211; even a manufactured one &#8211; will help him gain credibility and mettle.  This domestic focus seems to be the underlying reason for North Korea&#8217;s belligerence, and it is also the reason why other countries aren&#8217;t afraid of North Korea&#8217;s hostile actions.  Kim Jong-Un could care less if his missiles spur fear internationally, because he really wants them to inspire respect at home.

It&#8217;s not just North Korea that has been handing out mixed signals.  China, which is North Korea&#8217;s main trading partner and benefactor, has been doing exactly the same.  On one side, China has maintained both relations and trade with North Korea.  But on the other hand, China has allowed new economic sanctions against the North, bucking the trend of using its powerful position on the United Nations Security Council to block increased sanctions.  However, most of China&#8217;s recent criticism has been limited to words, not actions.  With the notable exception of allowing for those increased sanctions, China has merely been slapping North Korea on the wrist for their belligerence.  Considering that China is North Korea&#8217;s main ally and holds great influence over North Korea, it could do much more to stop the North&#8217;s recent aggression.

But while China may be maintaining somewhat of a relationship with North Korea, this recent aggression from North Korea will likely make the U.S.-North Korean relationship even more rocky.  Kim Jong-Un is willing to threaten America in order to improve his domestic standing, showing how little he values possible cooperation with the U.S. in the future.  Still, this standoffish tone towards the U.S. isn&#8217;t just a recent development, as it has manifested itself throughout Kim Jong-Un&#8217;s short tenure in office.  Even last year, Kim Jong-Un was quick to violate the terms of a food aid deal with the U.S. in order to test his country&#8217;s missile technology.  When this food aid deal was being created, we here at RantAWeek [hedged our bets](http://rantaweek.com/change-in-north-korea-march-3-2012/ "Change in North Korea"), arguing &#8220;there is no specific policy-based reason that would make Kim Jong Un voluntarily give up the nuclear program his father so obstinately worked to create&#8221; and warning that &#8220;failure to successfully execute this compromise could doom diplomatic relationships with the North Koreans for years to come&#8221;.

Kim Jong-Un still lacks any policy-based reason to stop his aggression, especially since China isn&#8217;t exerting pressure as harshly as it could be.  Worse, North Korea seems to have abandoned plans to cooperate with the United States.  But at the very least, the U.S. should take comfort in the fact that North Korea is not an international threat, just a country willing to sacrifice international cooperation for a new leader&#8217;s domestic credentials.
