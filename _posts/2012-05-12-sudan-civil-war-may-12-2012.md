The nation of Sudan has been rife with conflict for decades, but many hoped that tensions would subside when South Sudan broke away and became its own country last summer.  Unfortunately, the split has failed to decrease violence, and the two nations are edging closer to war.  The center of controversy lies at oilfields along the border which both countries lay claim to.  Complicating the situation is the fact that the exact border between the two nations has not yet been drawn because several areas in the vicinity of the disputed oil fields must still hold referendums to determine which country they want to be a part of.

South Sudan, perhaps more than its northern neighbor, is in desperate need of money from these oil fields.  Landlocked in the heart of Africa, South Sudan relies almost entirely on oil revenues to keep its economy functioning.  Without many other natural resources or a solid infrastructure, oil is a crucial factor for South Sudan&#8217;s development.  That being said, Sudan&#8217;s economy is also based off of oil and it will also be negatively affected by the loss of these oil lands.

Attempts at compromise have already been made.  The most viable plan was that South Sudan would pay Sudan a fraction of their oil revenues for the right to use Sudan&#8217;s existing pipelines.  On the surface, this plan makes sense.  Even without infrastructure of their own, South Sudan would be able to export their oil.  And even after losing some oil fields, Sudan would not lose all their oil revenues.

However, tensions between the two countries have built up to the point where border skirmishes and bombings are drawing the nations closer to more widespread violence.  Ominously, problems in Sudan have quickly escalated in the past, and there is no specific reason why we shouldn&#8217;t expect increased violence this time around.

Still, there is hope for peace.  To achieve a peaceable conclusion, leaders in both Sudans must be persuaded that a revenue sharing compromise deal is a better outcome than the outbreak of yet another civil war.  Unfortunately, even though international focus has been placed on preventing violence, the ongoing bloodshed over these oil fields has continued.  It seems that international attempts to fix the situation in Sudan may not amount to much success.  After all, even though the International Criminal Court has an outstanding arrest warrant against Sudan&#8217;s leader Omar al-Bashir, he remains in power.

But there seems to be internal hope for a nonviolent solution.  Sudan has said that it is willing to discuss matters with its southern counterpart, showing that the violence has not yet escalated to a point of no return.  With hope, these negotiations can bring an end to the violence and a more concrete plan for how to share the oilfields.  The Sudanese region has been riddled with violence for too long, so let&#8217;s hope they can work out a peaceful solution.
