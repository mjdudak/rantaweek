Greek bond yields for 10-year government bonds now stand at over 28%.  This, quite frankly, is a ridiculous number as it serves to prove that investors have no confidence in the long term reliability of Greek debt.  To demonstrate this, one must only do the math.  Let&#8217;s say an investor buys $100 worth of Greek debt.  The yield would then force Greece to pay this investor $28 dollars each and every year of the ten year term until the ten years expires.  Then, Greece would need to pay the original $100 loan back in full.  The total cost for Greece to borrow this $100 would end up being $380.  So, for every dollar that Greece is currently borrowing, they are expected to pay back almost four.

Then why is Greece allowing these bond rates to be so high?  The simple answer is necessity, as they need money now and understand that in their dire fiscal position, it will cost them greatly in order to simply stay afloat in the short term.  However, this only deepens their debt concerns as it increases the debt they will have to pay off in the future.  As such, investors have almost no faith in Greece holding off a default long enough to receive their money back.  Indeed, the only thing stopping these bond rates from being even higher than they are now is that fact that the European Central Bank is buying Greek bonds, creating demand and slightly slowing the rise of bond rates.  The ECB is trying to prove through its own actions that Greek debt is a viable investment.  Most investors and investing institutions, unfortunately for the ECB, already have come to the conclusion that Greece has no chance of avoiding a default.  The country has already preformed &#8216;debt restructurings&#8217; with the help of other eurozone leaders that were essentially selective defaults, where Greece was allowed to ignore a certain percentage of its debt.  Greece&#8217;s troubles are only multiplying, and it is basically impossible for Greece to try the old technique of growing its economy and using inflation to counteract the effects of high bond yields.  The eurozone is on the verge of a double dip recession, and it is simply not feasible to imagine Greece growing at a rate of 28% while everyone else in the E.U. is struggling to keep growth rates at 1 or 2 percent.

Greece&#8217;s problems have spurred many to call for Greece to leave the eurozone. And yet, this action would not really solve any issues, as it would only prove that Greece does not deserve the faith of investors.  Without the strength of the Euro to back it up, Greece&#8217;s problems would multiply.  The entire eurozone has banded together to help Greece because they understand that their problems are interconnected.  Just forcing Greece to stop using the Euro does not sever all of these connections.  After all, various European countries and banks hold Greek debt.  If they pressured Greece into giving up the Euro, it would represent the fact that they have given up on Greece.  Without any help from its neighbors, Greece would almost inevitably need to default, and the losses would directly affect the same countries and banks that tried to distance themselves from Greece in the first place.

There seems to be no way out of the debt contagion that could occur if Greece defaults, and European leaders are well aware that a loss on Greek debt could ruin other tottering European countries that seem to be on the verge of collapse.  For this reason, Europe has been forced into strengthening their economic ties to face this crisis instead of severing them.  The rest of the world must hope that some solution can be found.  If two heads are better than one, then the 17 countries of the eurozone should be able to come to some accords.  Disunion is a dangerous chasm that must be avoided.  The combined European Union represents the largest economy in the world, and it would be devastating to watch it fall down.
