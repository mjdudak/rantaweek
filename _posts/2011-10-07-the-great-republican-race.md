With the stubborn economy and consistently high unemployment numbers, Obama’s second term is in danger.  The big task for Republicans, however, is finding the right man to campaign against him.  And time is running rather short.  South Carolina has just moved up its primary date to January 21st, which will most likely put pressure on Iowa and New Hampshire (who historically have the first caucuses) to bump up their own respective schedules.  Needless to say, the Republican candidates need to quicken their pace to distance themselves from their rivals and stand out as the best challenger to take on Obama in the general election.

The list of current candidates, however, is most certainly not short.  While Michelle Bachmann, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich, John Huntsman, Ron Paul, Rick Perry, Mitt Romney, and Rick Santorum are the biggest names, the list does go on from there.  It seems, however, that even with the multitude of options presented to them, Republicans have not found a candidate they can rally around.  For a few weeks, Michelle Bachmann was all the rage as her fiery rhetoric and take it or leave it attitude won over many conservative voters, leading to a win at the Ames Iowa Straw Poll.  But, it was merely hours after that when Rick Perry burst onto the scene, starting a new fervor.  Unfortunately for Mr. Perry, the more prospective voters hear from him, the less they seem to like him, and his poll numbers have been falling steadily in response to a shift towards other candidates, namely Herman Cain<sup>(1)</sup>.  There has been a lot of buzz in recent weeks about the rise of Mr. Cain, but his fundraising capacity is still lackluster and his current book tour is a needless distraction from the campaign trail.  Chris Christie, the popular governor of New Jersey, declined a run even as supporters asked him to throw his hat into the ring.  Rumors of a Palin run for president ended the same way.

But did I forget someone important?  Mitt Romney has managed to stay out of the spotlight while maintaining solid polling numbers and raking in millions in fundraising for his campaign.  On the other hand, Romney fails to excite the conservative base and is seen by many Republicans as too much of a moderate.  But still, his moderate stances could help him win over moderate voters in a general election.  Mitt Romney, like all of the other Republicans, is a mixed bag, and, as such, it is possible to claim that the Election of 2012 will not be decided by who is participating in it.

To some, that last sentence may seem blasphemous when considering how campaigns work.  After all, isn’t the whole point of campaigning to show how you are better than all of the other candidates?  But the other side of the equation is Obama’s popularity, which has correlated quite well with the shape of the economy.  As more Americans become pessimistic about the economy, Obama’s poll numbers have declined <sup>(2)</sup>.  Still, with over a year to go before the actual election, the economy has time to improve.  Using positive economic indicators and lowered unemployment rates, Obama might be able to win over necessary votes and take the election.  However, if the trend of a souring economy and high unemployment continues, Obama might want to start packing his bags now.

As of now, Republican voters haven’t decided who they want their candidate to be.  But in the long run, this matters little.  The next few months will be host to even more debates and the very first primaries.  By mid to late February, the name of the Republican contender for the general election should be quite clear.  Still, his or her name might end up mattering little when compared to the state of the economy at large.
