I remember watching Obama&#8217;s announcement earlier this year that American military force was going to &#8216;help out&#8217; in Libya.  At the time, I tried to decide whether I agreed with his decision or if I felt that the conflict was not worth our money.  Since hindsight is 20/20, I can now say that operations in Libya have ended quite successfully, and that the Libyan rebels could not have achieved their victory without the help of international intervention.  However, looking to the past is quite easy, and what the Libyans are now concerned about is their future.

The best place to turn to as a bellwether for Libya&#8217;s future is Tunisia, Libya&#8217;s neighbor to the northwest and instigator of many of the revolutions that have occurred (and are still ongoing) in the Middle East this year.  After the Tunisians ousted their &#8216;President&#8217; Ben Ali this January, a transitional government, much like the one currently controlling Libya, was formed.  This transitional government has been working on organizing elections for the past nine months and most recently oversaw an election for the Constituent Assembly.  The election has been hailed as particularly important because this assembly will be charged with creating Libya&#8217;s new Constitution.  That&#8217;s why many Westerners were unnerved when an Islamic party won a plurality of seats.

But this is no cause for concern, as it makes sense that a moderate Islamic nation would want a moderate Islamic government. While Americans are used to near complete separation of church and state, the combining of the two is fairly common in the rest of the world.  As long as a government is not extreme in its execution of religious matters, the combination of religion and democratic government does not need to be looked upon as either evil or impossible.  Many of these groups, such as the Islamist Brotherhood in Egypt, served as a voice of political opposition during the years of one party rule.  It only makes sense that, after democracy has been established, this opposition will come to the forefront.

Speaking of Egypt, it is important to note that the steps to an election there have been rockier than in Tunisia.  This is a cause for concern, and international pressure must be focused on maintaining the scheduled dates for the Egyptian elections.  After all, they have already pushed back the date well into next year.

Egypt, Libya and Tunisia will benefit from renewed democracy in other ways because stable governments will bring renewed tourism.  All three countries have miles of Mediterranean shoreline that can be used to attract visitors and create a flow of money into these economies.  Oil is crucial, albeit most crucial in Libya, where a more friendly government should lead to an increase in oil production as western conglomerates snap up deals.  If governmental control is given to the people, more economic success can be shared by all.

It would also be unfair to not recognize the current troubles in both Syria and Yemen.  International pressure is just beginning to pick up in these countries. Hopefully, if the trend continues, democratic governments can be established in these countries as well.  The government in Syria, sadly, has used excessive violence to combat attempts for change.  Yemen is also tricky, but mainly because of its tribal nature and the growing presence of al-Qaeda within its borders.  Still, even with the problems that have occurred in these countries, the overarching trend in the Middle East is that of people yearning for democracy.  And even if that democracy is a little different than what westerners might expect, the Arab Revolutions are a positive turning point and an exciting hope for the future. -TM
