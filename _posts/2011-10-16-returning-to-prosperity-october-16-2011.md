In 2007, the housing bubble broke, leading to sub-prime mortgage failures in 2008.  In March of 2009, the Dow Jones and many stocks hit rock bottom.  But since then, things have gotten better… right?

Officially, America’s most recent recession ended in 2009, when GDP growth stopped declining and started to gain lost ground.  Last year, in 2010, the nation’s GDP actually grew by 2.9%, outpacing allies like France and the UK <sup>(1)</sup>.  That 2.9% was the largest amount of growth we’ve seen since 2005.  And yet, things don’t seem to be all that great right now for the American economy.  Why is this so?

The answer comes in three parts, which, as far as economic explanations go, are actually very simple.  First and foremost among America’s current economic woes is unemployment.  Yes, the rate has gone down from its high of 10.1% in 2009, but the current numbers are not that much better, and in the last few months unemployment has stubbornly sat at 9.1%<sup>(2)</sup>.  In happier economic times, America often has had unemployment rates around 5%.  The problem with unemployment is that it stifles future growth.  If people don’t have jobs, they aren’t going to purchase a new TV.  As such, the TV manufacturers aren’t making the money they need to hire new employees.  The circle is vicious, and the seemingly ever increasing amounts of outsourcing are only adding more injuries to the precarious situation.  Government efforts to spur job creation have made small advances at best.  More needs to be done to get people back to their jobs, and in turn back to growing the economy.

Secondly, the growth numbers in themselves distort the truth of the growth they claim.  Sure we had 2.9% growth in 2010, but this number is given as a year-over-year figure.  In 2009, the economy shrank by 2.7%.  Sure, we may have recovered our losses from 2009, but this still leaves America with nearly a flat growth rate for the two years combined.  Even a poor economy is an improvement from an abysmal one.  And all this is occurring while countries like China and India braved the global recession while posting annual growth rates close to 10%.  America’s growth may seem like it is returning to normal, but a closer look at the numbers paints a drearier picture.

The comparison with China and India segues into the third point, that stable growth is becoming harder as America has to compete with these manufacturing powerhouses.  The solution to this problem, however, is a solution that can be readily applied to improving our economy as a whole, which would lower unemployment and raise growth in the process.  As the middle classes of developing economies grow, they look to the American middle class as the ultimate standard.  American companies can capitalize on this, using our high-tech and established industries, as well as American workers, to cater to their new needs.  Even as we need more and more goods from China and India, the new middle classes there will be looking for quality foreign products that our businesses can supply.  America needs to create strategic long-term partners, and not view everything as a competition.  Working together with other countries can often produce the best results.  The American economy is not at a point of prosperity yet, but we’re getting there, and the world is ready for us when we do.-TM
