Let&#8217;s be upfront.  The second presidential debate is unlikely to have nearly as much of an impact as the first one.  President Obama&#8217;s poor performance, coupled with Romney&#8217;s well used aggression, allowed Romney to win a significant swing in the polls following that first debate.  The more recent town hall debate, however, saw mediocre performances from both candidates, making it not nearly as big of a news story.

Even though Obama was labelled as a slight favorite in many polls taken after the debate had finished, this conclusion can be partially attributed to Obama&#8217;s poor performance in the first debate, which likely led many to lower their expectations.  And while Obama did successfully become more aggressive Tuesday night, Romney was able to sustain his offensive from the debate before.  All in all, neither candidate faltered or appeared weak.  Unfortunately, both candidates&#8217; attempts to show strength by staunchly defending their positions often resulted in a contentious disagreement of what should have been mere facts.  Consider this discussion about oil production:

> Romney: And production on private- on government land&#8230;
> 
> Obama: Production is up.
> 
> Romney: &#8230; is down.
> 
> Obama: No, it isn&#8217;t.
> 
> Romney: Production on government land of oil is down 14 percent.
> 
> Obama: Governor&#8230;
> 
> Romney: And production on gas&#8230;
> 
> Obama: It&#8217;s just not true.

Additionally, the candidates were so intent on maintaining form and style that the debate often lost substance as legitimate questions were transformed into talking points.  One question focused on what the candidates would do to solve the gender pay gap in the workplace.  Obama went first, diving into &#8216;storytime&#8217; where he discussed his prior record on the subject but avoided the question at hand.  When he finally transitioned away from this backstory, he simply made some vague statements about education and Pell grants.  A plethora of platitudes does not equal policy.  Unfortunately, Romney also failed to answer the question, mimicking Obama and talking about his background on the issue.  And when Romney exited storytime, his platitudes were directed towards general economic improvement, not the condition of the modern woman.  Both responses sounded on-topic in the spur of the moment, but neither actually answered the question.

This debate will hardly stand out in the history books as a game changer, but it was disappointing to see an opportunity to discuss policy sacrificed to protect the candidates against risky statements or poor delivery.  Since this debate is unlikely to spur momentum for either candidate, we should expect the race to continue, more or less, with its current equilibrium in the polls.  A wash for this debate is actually a boon for President Obama, because his position as the favorite is benefited when Romney loses another chance to catch up in the polls.  Still, with one more debate next Monday and more than two weeks to the election, it&#8217;s important to remember that this race is not over yet.
