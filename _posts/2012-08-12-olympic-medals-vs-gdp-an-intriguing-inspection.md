The size of a nation&#8217;s economy naturally affects how well that country will do in the Olympics.  After all, larger and richer nations should generally be able to field bigger and stronger teams.  This explains why, as the world&#8217;s largest economy, the United States was able to win the most medals.  Second in the medal standings was China, the world&#8217;s second largest economy.

To truly analyze how well a country preformed in the Olympics, it is thus necessary to examine its medal count relative to the size of its economy.  Determining the size of a nation&#8217;s economy is simple: this analysis used 2011 estimates of gross domestic product from the CIA World Factbook¹.  Examining the medal count, however, forces a decision on how to weigh the differences between gold, silver and bronze.

It is fairly safe to say that all Olympic medals should not be counted equally.  Winning a gold carries more prestige than a silver, and silver carries more prestige than a bronze.  But how should we measure this?

Upon noticing that the United States Olympic Committee pays athletes $25,000 for a gold, $15,000 for a silver and $10,000 for a bronze, I decided to use these payouts as a weighing system for the medals.  A bronze medal is then 1 &#8216;medal point&#8217;, a silver 1.5, and a gold will be worth 2.5.  (It should be noted that Russia also awards payouts at similar ratios, another reason this weighing was chosen.)

Here are the results: calculated medal points vs. GDP for economies larger than $1 trillion.

Notice that even though the United States and China have the most medal points, their results are nothing special due to the extreme size of their economies.  The United States, in fact, is actually below the line of best fit.  More impressive are the feats of Russia and the United Kingdom.  Despite their much smaller economies, they are able to post impressive numbers of medal points.  On the other hand, even though Brazil and India are rapidly developing economies, their medal points are unimpressive, and they fall well under the line of best fit.

The three unlabeled countries above the line of best fit are France, Italy and South Korea, who join already labeled Germany as nations that slightly over-performed.  The six unlabeled (and thus under-performing) countries underneath the line are Mexico, Spain, Indonesia, Canada, Turkey and Iran.  Most surprising is Indonesia.  Even with one of the largest economies in the world, Indonesia only managed to win one silver and one bronze, worth a mere 2.5 medal points.  However, this can be explained by noticing that Indonesia only sent 22 athletes to the Olympics.  When compared to other nations of similar economic clout, Indonesia chose to send a tiny representation.

The case of Indonesia demonstrates that factors other than GDP affect Olympic results.  After all, some countries simply choose to become more competitive than others.  As the host nation, the U.K. was more driven towards success.  Thus, they significantly outperformed most of their peers.

Take this data with a grain of salt, as GDP is not alone in predicting Olympic success or failure.  However, also consider this data to be a new alternative to the more traditional and basic medal count.  After all, when it comes to the Olympics, athletics are important, but money plays a crucial role as well.
