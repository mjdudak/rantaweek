When the debt crisis fiasco was &#8216;solved&#8217; this summer, the actual task of tackling the nation&#8217;s deficit was largely ignored.  Talks between President Obama and Speaker of the House John Boehner fell apart, forcing a last minute bill to extend the time for compromise.  The debt ceiling was raised, and a super-committee of 12 members of Congress, containing 6 Democrats and 6 Republicans, was appointed to create a bipartisan deal that would trim at least 1.2 trillion dollars from the nation&#8217;s deficit over the next 10 years.

This idea turned out to be filled with lofty ambitions, as hope for such a bipartisan package quickly fell apart.  Republicans pledged to not raise any taxes, even as part of a larger program to lessen the deficit.  At the same time, Democrats refused to consider Republican proposals that cut back harshly on welfare and social programs.  Simply put, nothing got done.

But that statement may be too simple, as Republican senator Pat Toomey came up with a plan that would trim the deficit by removing certain deductions on yearly tax forms.  Some saw it as a Republican compromise to the &#8216;no tax hikes&#8217; pledge.  And yet, nothing came of it, and the deadline for action by the super-committee came and went.  It is thus inaccurate to say that there are no ideas  in Washington, and the actual problem is that no compromise exists.

The blame for this lies in the ever-increasingly partisan atmosphere that has enveloped Congress.  Republicans control the House while Democrats have the Senate and Presidency.  While one would wish for this split control to force compromise, it has done the exact opposite, as neither party wants to water down their plans for economic recovery by diluting them with ideas from the other party.  The consequence of this is that no big deals can be passed through both houses.  However, Congress is expected to use compromise in order to lay out a path for the nation&#8217;s future.  Right now, our Congresspeople have by and large shown an inability to do this, presenting a problem.

The real impetus for changing the ways of Congress, however, does not lie within Congress itself.  The people are the ultimate deciders of who should represent them in the halls of the Capitol. For this reason, the best votes in 2012 may not be for the candidates who pledge to always stick to their platforms, for instead for the ones who will allow some room for compromise.  Without compromise, after all, it is almost impossible to accomplish anything in a divided government.
