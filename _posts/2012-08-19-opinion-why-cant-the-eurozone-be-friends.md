Yet they are starting to return, and work is beginning again. After replacing Lucas Papademos in June, Antonis Samaras, current Prime Minister of Greece, will face his first big challenge in drumming up international support. He will visit Angela Merkel, Chancellor of Germany and Francois Holllande, President of France. Samaras&#8217; primary goal will be an extension on debt owed and loosened impositions of austerity. Basically, Samaras will go begging to the two biggest leaders in the Eurozone to try to get them to loosen the shackles they have put on Greece. But with Greece once again asking for relief, the Eurozone leaders are no doubt questioning what to do for Greece. After many negotiations have ended with nothing, simply in-fighting, the next few months for the debt crisis will be as vital as ever.

Many are no doubt looking at some form of Eurozone breakup, ranging from Greece being the sole exiting country (being called &#8220;Grexit&#8221;), the fringe countries all exiting or simply the Eurozone not existing anymore. However, when looking at the collateral damage caused to everyone, both the creditors (Germany and France primarily) and debtors (Greece, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Ireland etc.), any sort of breakup does not seem possible. For the creditors, it leaves them with huge sums of unpaid debt, and for the debtors, they have no help from outside forces to get their economies back on track. While many within the creditors, especially Germany, are pressuring their leaders for a breakup, they do not realize just how disastrous this could be.

The other option, and the one that seems to make the most sense, is a further mutualization of economic burden. Basically, the Eurozone needs to create a Eurobond, which essentially equalizes all debt in the Eurozone. This would require debtors and creditors to get along better, but doing so may work. Creditors would suffer a minor blow from this, but not as large as could be imposed with any sort of break up. Debtors meanwhile, would feel much of the burdens of their debt lifted, and in turn would be able to focus on getting their economies back on track. Additionally, inflation needs to be introduced to further ease economic burden. It would only minorly affect the creditors, while greatly helping the debtors. Together, however, these approaches would only somewhat ease the debtors, bringing them back slightly from the verge of collapse. Once this equalization of the burden is done, the debtors still will find themselves dealing with struggling economies. While no longer bridled with debt, they will need to cut down unemployment and get their various sectors producing again. In order to do so, stimulus must be introduced. The idea that austerity will help economic growth is faulty once the issue of large debts is mostly dealt with. This stimulus should be primarily a plan resembling the New Deal, one of government spending in infrastructure and such that will benefit everyone. Greece, in their recession, has revealed several infrastructure problems, including electricity, and government induced stimulus could help to fix them. With this stimulus, there must also be a focus on youth unemployment, as it is one of the primary ailments of Greece and other debtors. If they can get the young, motivated workforce back to work, this will be an important catalyst in economic growth. Debt mutualization, coupled with inflation and direct government stimulus will allow debtors to see necessary short term outcomes, while creditors will see long term growth.

Europeans are suffering debt crisis fatigue. Those in the creditor countries feel like their money is being drained into the debtors. The debtors meanwhile are feeling fatigue over the stringent austerity that has been imposed. Yet by mutualizing debt, and creating system-wide growth, both sides will begin to see each other in a new light. Fatigue will be lifted.

So as the leaders get back to work, if the creditors can agree to take a bit of the fall for the debtors, and help the debtors grow, stability and growth can be restored to the Eurozone. Because of the bickering that has been experienced in all negotiations, this may be a stretch, but working together will work better.
