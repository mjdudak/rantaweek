[Enrique Peña Nieto](http://rantaweek.com/mexicos-presidential-election-april-2-2012/ "Mexico’s Presidential Election"), Mexico&#8217;s new president, campaigned on optimistic hopes of fixing Mexico&#8217;s sluggish economy and solving the six year old drug war.  But now that he has taken office, his lofty rhetoric will be challenged by the deep-set problems Mexico faces.  Optimism is one thing, but actual leadership is another.

First, if Nieto wants to dramatically improve Mexico, he must combat the political instability his election has caused.  Even though Nieto did win the election, he only garnered 38% of the vote, and as such can hardly claim he has a mandate from the Mexican populace to enact his policies.  Among the majority of Mexicans who did not vote for Nieto, many are afraid that his alignment with the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) will lead to an increase in corruption.  For the later half of the twentieth century, the PRI ruled Mexico with an iron first.  The rather recent memories of authoritarian rule are ingrained in the minds of many Mexicans, who are wary of the party regaining power.  Worse, allegations that Nieto accepted bribes in order to help spur his campaign to victory sparked protests as he was inaugurated.  This political instability means that Nieto lacks the trust of his constituency, and without this trust it will be more difficult for him to pursue his policies.  Nieto&#8217;s lack of political popularity could compromise his leadership and prevent Mexico from focusing on the problems it faces.

And unfortunately for Peña Nieto, Mexico&#8217;s problems may be too deep for a simple change in leadership to fix.  Mexico&#8217;s War on Drugs started back in 2006, but has failed to make the impact it was supposed to.  Instead of curbing the power of cartels, the drug war has actually led to a recent increase in crime, and drug related violence is still widespread.  Many attempts to combat the cartels have been made moot through corruption, and Nieto&#8217;s membership in the notoriously corrupt PRI makes him an odd choice to fight against Mexico&#8217;s more unscrupulous leaders.  And even if Nieto does want to make battling corruption a major issue, he may find difficulty in getting widespread support for his measures.

Nieto will also be expected to tackle Mexico&#8217;s economic problems, as Mexico&#8217;s relatively slow growth makes it lag behind many other Latin American nations.  Unfortunately, Mexico&#8217;s economy is not only suffering from the cyclical aftereffects of the worldwide recession but also has more ingrained economic problems that Nieto will not be easily able to counter.  However, his optimistic rhetoric during the campaign gave the implication that fast economic change could be expected.  Nieto may face a disappointed populace as actual economic improvements move far slower than the pace many overoptimistic supporters expected.  Americans well remember how Barack Obama&#8217;s approval ratings fell quickly in his first few months as economic problems continued, even though the reality is that most economic policies can take months or years to fully affect the economy.  It is likely Nieto may face a similar problem.

But all this being said, Enrique Peña Nieto is a charismatic leader with a decent record as state governor who may be able to help tackle some of his country&#8217;s biggest problems if he can successfully implement policy.  Unfortunately, he first faces the task of turning rhetoric into action, and must prove himself as a capable leader, not just a capable campaigner.
