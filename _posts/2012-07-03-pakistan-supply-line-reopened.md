Last November, U.S. led NATO forces and the Pakistani army clashed for unknown reasons, leaving 24 Pakistani soldiers dead.  As a sign of anger against what they declared was an unprovoked attack, Pakistani leaders closed the NATO supply route that went through their country.  This action complicated NATO&#8217;s counter-terrorism efforts, leading to tensions, especially with the United States.  [RantAWeek reported in May](http://rantaweek.com/problems-pakistan-yemen/ "Problems in Pakistan and Yemen") that even though Pakistan&#8217;s President Zardari came to the Chicago NATO summit, no deal was worked out to reopen the supply line, showing that tensions still existed.

However, the power of an apology finally brought the issue to a conclusion.  U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave Pakistan an apology for the deaths of their soldiers, quickly leading to an agreement to reopen the closed supply route.

This symbolizes a new step forward for U.S.-Pakistan relations, but also a step forward for Pakistan itself.  After all, better relations with NATO members makes Pakistan appear much more stable.  For much of the year, Pakistan&#8217;s government [seemed susceptible to a coup](http://rantaweek.com/problems-within-pakistan-january-15-2012/ "Problems Within Pakistan"), and observers questioned if President Zardari would be able to maintain control of his country.  Zardari has kept his power, but his Prime Minister was forced out of office by the Supreme Court just weeks ago.  The fact that new Prime Minister Raja Ashraf has overseen such a dramatic change in policy so quickly after his election points towards a strengthening Pakistani government.

NATO and middle eastern countries such as Pakistan are co-dependent when it comes to fighting terrorism, and cooperation between the two is imperative to security.  Tensions threatened a united front against terrorism, but renewed relations promise a brighter future.

Pakistan&#8217;s assistance is key.  NATO plans to leave Afghanistan by the end of 2014, meaning that both Pakistan and Afghanistan will have to work on combating terrorist cells that historically have had a presence near the border of the two countries.  If a record of cooperation can not be established now, it will be more difficult for the two countries to work together later, without the assistance of NATO.

The War on Terror has been helped by this supply line and was hurt by its closure.  It&#8217;s a relief to see tensions subsiding and the route reopening.
