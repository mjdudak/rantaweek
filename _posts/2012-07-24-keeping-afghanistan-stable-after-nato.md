After ten years, billions of dollars and around two thousand lives have been spent on the Iraq war, NATO forces plan to leave the country by the end of 2014.  It is imperative that the U.S. and other NATO countries, even without troops on the ground, provide some assistance to Afghanistan in order to continue combating terrorism within the country.  Mutual fears of a Taliban resurgence necessitate both goodwill and cooperation.

Perhaps the largest problem Afghanistan faces after the NATO withdrawal is economic.  Nearly the entirety of the nation&#8217;s economy is built on providing goods and services for foreign soldiers.  With the imminent removal of these soldiers, many have begun to fear the destabilization that would come from severe economic setbacks.  To combat this, a group of countries, including the United States, have pledged $16 billion in aid over 4 years.

Unfortunately, aid is not a permanent solution for supporting and maintaining a healthy economy.  The United States has already expressed support for Afghanistan to develop strong trading ties.  By trying to stimulate trade, the United States is working to prevent an economic collapse that could weaken the government and strengthen the Taliban.  With hope, this move will help establish a healthy economy for a more stable Afghanistan.

But war is not only fought on the economic front.  The Afghan army has received criticisms for being corrupt and ineffective against the Taliban.  Without NATO troops, however, the Afghan army is entrusted with unilaterally combating the Taliban&#8217;s insurgency.  To provide some assistance, U.S. support may still be needed.

Even though American troops will soon be leaving, the U.S. has demonstrated its continued support by declaring Afghanistan to be a major non-NATO ally.  It seems likely for the U.S. to strengthen their words with actions by continuing to train Afghan soldiers even after the 2014 deadline.  This way, even though America would be forced to use their military as a consultant, it would combat any attempts by the Taliban to increase their control at the expense of the Afghan forces.  Simply put, America&#8217;s duty to combat terrorism does not end after 2014.

America must also avoid the trap of considering Afghanistan while forgetting Pakistan.  Since the two countries share a border that is often used by terrorists as a refuge, any discussion of terrorism in Afghanistan should also bring Pakistan into the picture.  Even though U.S. relations with Pakistan were tense for the first half of 2012, the recent [deal to reopen supply lines](http://rantaweek.com/pakistan-supply-line-reopened/ "Pakistan Supply Line Reopened") demonstrates a push for detente by both nations.  A deeper alliance with Pakistan could help Afghanistan better combat terrorism.  And while past relations between the two countries may lead to doubts about such an alliance, United States interests would be well served by looking for better cooperation between Afghan and Pakistani governments.  The U.S. may need to proceed cautiously at first, but it seems likely that some push for this will occur.  After many Middle Eastern stumbles, the U.S. should know to focus on regional trends and not just the struggles of individual countries.

In order to successfully prevent a Taliban resurgence after the [Afghan pullout](http://rantaweek.com/afghan-pullout-april-15-2012/ "Leaving Afghanistan"), the U.S. must continue cooperation.  Leaving Afghanistan to fend for itself is not sound foreign policy.  The country is, at present, too weak to be trusted with the full prevention of terrorism within its borders.  However, America is setting up a policy of teamwork that will hopefully provide stability, even after 2014.
