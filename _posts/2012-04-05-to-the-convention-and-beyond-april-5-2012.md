Tuesday, Mitt Romney took three more primaries: Wisconsin, DC and Maryland. This brings Romney up to 658 delegates, now only 486 delegates away from clinching the nomination. However, these primaries again do little but reiterate what other primaries proved: Romney is the best candidate there is and is back to seeming inevitable. Rick Santorum, Ron Paul and Newt Gingrich are still campaigning hard, but their campaigns are starting to falter and become worthless. Romney has gone from &#8220;Romney, the inevitable&#8221; to &#8220;Romney, the only sane guy left.&#8221;

Romney&#8217;s campaign for the longest time was so smoothly run that Romney never made any major gaffes that seriously set him back. But, inevitably, Romney has started to make more and more mistakes that alienate him from the average voter. He has transitioned from a candidate who was simply cold and lacked charisma to one who is so far removed from the public. Whether it be him answering a sports question by discussing the actual owners of the teams, talking about the &#8220;couple of Cadillacs&#8221; his wife drives or his campaign manager stating that they could start over with the campaign like an Etch-A-Sketch, Romney has shown himself increasingly removed from everyday society. Regardless of how well he is doing in the Republican primaries, Romney is almost winning by default. Santorum&#8217;s extreme views still turn off too many voters, Gingrich&#8217;s views and living in Santorum&#8217;s shadow makes him hardly anyone&#8217;s favorite, and Paul is simply too wacky for the American public. Â This leaves Romney as the only truly electable candidate. Notice I say electable, not likable.

Given all that is good about Romney: his sanity, his moderate views, his business background, and most importantly, his hair, the man has no problem being respected and electable, but no one seems to be able to get genuinely excited about Mitt Romney. As the American electorate sees more and more of Mitt Romney, the more they realize that he is nothing like them.

As we move closer to the general election, it seems as if Romney will likely win the nomination. Santorum, Paul and Gingrich have simply lost too much ground to make up over the next few months. But looking beyond that, it is clear that Romney will have a very tough time truly relating to people and going against Obama. People are still excited about Obama. He has charisma, great speaking ability, and humble beginnings. This formula seems much more preferable to Romney&#8217;s, involving starting over, being super rich, lacking charisma, being super rich and having great hair. Oh, and being super rich. The state of the economy may indicate that people want someone who is good at making money, but more important than that is the fact that people are out of jobs. Unemployment will no doubt be one of the biggest issues in the general election. Since most people have some relation to a friend or family member out of a job, someone who comes from humble beginnings and has worked their way up is a lot more friendly to the average voter. This leaves Obama left to charm America once again while Romney will likely just turn them away in mass droves with every time he mentions his wealth.
