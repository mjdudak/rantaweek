[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2356" title="Euro" src="http://rantaweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/euro-300x200.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="200" srcset="http://rantaweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/euro-300x200.jpg 300w, http://rantaweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/euro.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />](http://rantaweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/euro.jpg)German Chancellor Angela Merkel has advocated the use of cost-cutting austerity measures to solve economic woes in countries like Greece.  The measures, she argues, will create more fiscally prudent countries.  French President Francois Hollande has been a vocal critic of Angela Merkel&#8217;s policies.  Instead, he wants to use additional government spending to stimulate troubled economies, allowing Europe to grow out of its problems.

Germany wants governments to save.  France wants them to spend.  While embracing both philosophies simultaneously creates an apparent paradox, Europe has committed to both austerity and stimulus in combating the debt crisis.

Critics abound, arguing that austerity will undermine attempts at stimulus and vice-versa.  Instead of two different plans muddling the way forward for troubled countries, these critics believe a direct solution will provide a more feasible route to economic security.

By railing against the complexity of the currently proposed solutions, thees critics demonstrate their own lack of foresight.  If Europe&#8217;s problems only required a simple solution, the problem would already be solved.  In reality, the debt crisis is a complicated problem that will likely require a multi-faceted solution.  Suggesting a solution is invalid because of its complexity is a flawed argument.

Critics may still latch to the fact that as an apparent paradox, the two-pronged solution to the debt crisis is doomed to failure.  But this argument is, once again, too simple.  Upon further inspection, a solution to what is only a surface-level paradox can be discovered.  Austerity and stimulus can coexist because they can be applied to different sectors of the economy.  Beleaguered sectors such as banking and finance may need extra capital, but that does not ruin attempts at austerity.

Bickering and disagreements lead to polarization, and polarization usually translates to a one-sided approach when dealing with large-scale affairs. Europe can not afford to let that happen.  If a mixture of austerity and stimulus sounds like a feasible plan to help save beleaguered nations within the Eurozone, then this plan should not be criticized based on faulty logic.
