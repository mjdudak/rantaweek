Apparently, claiming land in the modern world is still as easy as planting a flag into the ground. In 2007, Russia drilled a titanium flag into the bedrock under the North Pole, thereafter claiming the entire Arctic Circle as their own hoping to access the newfound oil plains underneath the polar cap. Naturally, the international community did not take kindly to the aggressive land claims. Unfortunately this is not an isolated incident. Proposed NATO missile shields and growing internal conflict have Moscow acting out of fear that its influence is declining. Russia is reverting back to its Soviet tendencies but with new economic stratagem in a move that could destabilize current world relations

In the last decade, Russia has dramatically increased its natural gas exportation to become the world&#8217;s number one exporter. This gives them both economic and physical power over importers. The New York Times (January, 2009) shows Russia demonstrating this power dramatically when it cut off all natural gas flow through Ukraine and into Europe after Ukraine refused to meet the demands of the Russian gas giant, Gazprom. The gas was shut off in the middle of winter provoking Romania to declare a state of emergency and European leaders to scramble to find a solution as tens of thousands of people went without heat. Russia&#8217;s harsh crackdown on business policy shows the lengths they will go in order to retain their economic strength.

Moscow&#8217;s most ambitious move yet, however, has been their plan for a Eurasian economic union. Once again boasting Russia&#8217;s vast economic strength, Putin expressed the desire for a strong economic partnership with neighboring countries to rival that of the European Union. This comes at a time when Putin also has tried to get old Soviet countries to adopt the ruble and increase free trade. A London Guardian article (October, 2011) explains that customs deals with Belarus and Kazakhstan have set these plans in motion. The deals are set to bind the three countries as a &#8216;unified economic zone&#8217; in 2012, setting up the base for the Eurasian Union. Â The selection of the strong members of the ex-Soviet Bloc demonstrates strong undertones of their socialist history as Russia tries to show off their fiscal influence by challenging the European Union.

There are viable and beneficial solutions to curbing Russia&#8217;s potentially harmful influence. The first step is continuing the environmental crusade. Reducing dependence on fossil fuels by redoubling the push for renewable energy will make Russia&#8217;s natural gas dominance much less powerful. Simultaneously, the environmental push will encourage technological innovation benefiting the environment as well. Second, the European Union needs to consider expanding its membership. A recent article in the Economist states how Ukraine has been vying for a position in the European Union since the 1990s. Opening up the EU will further free trade and accessibility in Europe. Just proposing the admittance of old Soviet Bloc countries will effectively reduce Russia&#8217;s ability to create an influential Eurasian Union as the states flock to garner European influence. While neither solution is simple, the time and effort put in by European leaders will be important to curtailing the potential political and economic destabilization that another Russian superpower would create.

Russia is clearly attempting to reassert itself as a world superpower, but this time focusing economically rather than militarily, a move that will destabilize the current balance of power if left unchecked. Claiming the arctic is clearly not all that Russia is planning for the future, but with collaboration and multilateral communication, the world can ensure that titanium flags are the least of our worries.
