The weeks before Election Day are looking awfully numbered.  Although the race between President Obama and Mitt Romney was rather close for much of the summer, the fall has brought a decided advantage for Mr. Obama.  It all started with the party conventions.  Both candidates received a burst of increased support from their party&#8217;s convention.  However, the Democrats held their convention second, blocking much of Romney&#8217;s momentum and having the opportunity to rebut the Republicans on many issues.  For this reason, Obama&#8217;s convention bounce has lasted much longer than Romney&#8217;s did.

Unfortunately for the Republican camp, the bad news does not end there.  The release of a candid video showing Romney speaking to attendees at a high-cost fundraiser has garnered the Republican candidate a heap of bad press.  In the video, Romney says that it is not his job to worry about the 47% of Americans who do not pay income tax.  The controversy surrounding this sound bite has distracted the Romney campaign and has hurt Romney in his attempts to relate to voters.

Of course, the effects of Romney&#8217;s rocky last few weeks go deeper than this.  A noticeable shift towards Mr. Obama has occurred in polling on both the national and state level.  As crucial states such as Florida and Ohio appear to be slipping away from Romney, his electoral math becomes more and more complicated.  We here at RantAWeek [examined the electoral math back in April](http://rantaweek.com/the-electoral-college-doing-the-math-april-27-2012/ "The Electoral College: Doing the Math"), and we still stand behind our conclusion that the most reasonable Romney win forces him to take both Florida and Ohio.  This means that if the election were held today, polls show a fairly dismal case for the Romney camp.

But the election is not today, meaning that Romney still has the opportunity to play catch-up.  There are a variety of ways for him to rebound in the polls.  However, many of these ways are beyond his control.  Bad economic data is possible, but not guaranteed.  An Obama gaffe is also possible, but shouldn&#8217;t be counted on.

This does not mean Romney is helpless.  A strong performance at the debates &#8211; the first is October 3rd &#8211; could help him gain positive momentum.  Additionally, Romney can benefit himself by putting an increased focus on the issues and policy.  By doing so, he can help put his gaffes behind him and relaunch a rhetorical offensive against Obama&#8217;s views.

Romney is certainly in an underdog position right now.  A combination of controllable and uncontrollable factors determine whether he will be able to make up lost ground.  And with election day rapidly approaching, that lost ground needs to be made up rather quickly.
