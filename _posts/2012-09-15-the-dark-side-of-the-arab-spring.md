On Septemeber 11th, protests in Egypt resulted in a storming of the American Embassy in Cairo.  That same day, an attack was made on U.S. officials in Libya, killing the American ambassador.  These acts of violence were reportedly instigated by an anti-Islam video posted online.

Of course, the exact justification for the events that have unfolded remains to be clear.  While an inflammatory video is certainly capable of sparking outrage, mere anger alone should not be expected to lead to the storming of an embassy.  The attack in Libya is even more mysterious, and there is no sure connection between the video and the shooting.

But even as authorities investigate the exact chain of events, the incidents in both Egypt and Libya have sparked increased anti-Western sentiment across the Arab World.  Protests have erupted from Nigeria to Bangladesh, representing a deep-seated distrust of Western powers by the general populace in varying Muslim-majority countries.

These recent protests highlight a transition originally sparked by the Arab Spring.  This transition, marked by a shift from authoritarian secularism to both democracy and Islamist tendencies, has reinvigorated tensions between the Middle East and the Western world.

Western governments, it should be noted, are partly responsible for creating the conditions that led to this shift.  As the Western world condoned the actions of secular autocrats, Islamist groups often served as the main political opposition to these leaders in the absence of international pressure.  Even though the Arab Spring was a series of secular and not religious revolutions, the power void created in its wake allowed the already established Islamist oppositions to take control.

Still, this Islamist control of post-Arab Spring countries does not fully explain the actions that occurred in Egypt and Libya.  They most certainly don&#8217;t explain the protests occurring in many countries largely unchanged by the Arab Spring.  In fact, Mohamed Morsi, the president who controls Egypt&#8217;s moderate Islamist government, has repeated his calls for an end to the violence and a return to normalcy.  New Islamist governments should not receive the blame for recent actions.

A more reasonable explanation is that the video was viewed by the Muslim populace of many nations as yet another injustice against the Muslim world condoned by the U.S. and other Western powers.  This theory helps explain why protests have spread to Muslim countries not affected by the Arab Spring even though they started in the Arab Spring hotspots of Egypt and Libya.

The whole series of incidents underlines the growing symptoms of a worsening clash between Western democratic ideals and Islamic beliefs.  The incendiary video is of course protected by free speech- a basic tenet of democracy.  But on the flip side, the Islamic world places just as much value on the sanctity of their religion as Westerners do on the freedom of their speech.  Westerners are long accustomed to the obscene and occasionally revolting side-effects of free speech.   Much of the Arab world is not, and they should thus be expected to be more sensitive to its abuses.

The continuing turmoil in the Middle East is an unwelcome turn for Westerners.  However, it is also an expected and logical effect of ongoing trends.  As the Middle East struggles to find its place in the larger world, natural clashes between established traditions and new values should be expected, even if the results of these clashes are unwelcome.
