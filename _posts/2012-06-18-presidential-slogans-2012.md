A political slogan can make or break a campaign.  Obama&#8217;s &#8220;Yes We Can&#8221; was much more inspiring during the gloomy economic days of late 2008 than McCain&#8217;s bland &#8220;Country First&#8221;.  As a crucial element of the election cycle, slogans can define a candidacy, but only if they catch on and strike a message.

Obama&#8217;s team must have found it difficult to create a follow-up for &#8220;Yes We Can&#8221;, but they managed to mold the same optimism into their 2012 slogan &#8220;Forward&#8221;.  That being said, such a cheery slogan invites criticism.  Romney has already seized on the opportunity, saying that Obama&#8217;s policies will cause America to go &#8216;forward over a cliff&#8217;.

But even if there are some holes in Obama&#8217;s pick, Romney&#8217;s first choice for a slogan was also far from perfect.  While &#8220;Forward&#8221; at least indicates some direction out of our current issues, Romney&#8217;s &#8220;Believe in America&#8221; seemed staid.

Romney&#8217;s campaign must have realized this, because Romney has started to use &#8220;Putting Jobs First&#8221; instead.  Since this new slogan focuses on one of the election&#8217;s biggest issues (unemployment), it appears to be a much more effective choice.

But just like Obama&#8217;s selection, &#8220;Putting Jobs First&#8221; invites criticism.  A study, used by Obama to bash Romney&#8217;s record on dealing with the economy, placed Massachusetts as the 4th worst state in the nation for job growth during Romney&#8217;s tenure as governor.

The study has been criticized, with the basic argument being that it fails to include other factors such as overall growth and population shifts.  However, the statistic itself can still become detrimental to Romney&#8217;s campaign if he continues to focus on jobs.

Then again, if Obama turns up the heat on Romney for his jobs record, Romney has an ample counterattack with the statistic that the unemployment rate has increased from 7.8%  to 8.2% since January 2009, when Obama took office.  Romney&#8217;s talking point here is easy: Obama should not be allowed a second term to move &#8220;Forward&#8221; if he failed to reduce unemployment in his first term.

Like the statistic against Romney, the overall increase in unemployment can also be countered.  After all, Obama did manage to stop the trend of an increasing unemployment rate and has overseen a significant reduction in unemployment over the last two and a half years.  Still, the recent slowdown in job growth means that Obama remains vulnerable on the jobs front.

Neither slogan looks perfect, and that&#8217;s a shame.  I _still_ like Ike, but nothing here looks ripe to stand out in the history books.
