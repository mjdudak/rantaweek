The Eurozone is in a debt conundrum, and with the Greek debt crisis becoming more worrisome every day, Europe is in need of a helping hand.  But before we discuss the possible solutions, it is best to start with the problem itself.

Weak countries in Europe, namely Portugal, Ireland, Italy, Greece and Spain, have too much debt to safely carry.  In a bad economy, their respective governments are having problems paying the bills.  This became a dire concern for Greece in recent weeks and its leaders announced that they needed another bailout.  This only exemplifies that things are not improving in Greece, as the country has already received two such bailouts in as many years.  However, European leaders know that Greece can not fail as a sovereign debt default of a member of the Eurozone would spark debt contagion and destabilize the Euro.  To prevent these disastrous consequences, two countries, Germany and China, have stepped into leadership positions.

Let&#8217;s first discuss Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel has taken a leadership position within the Eurozone to finding a solution.  Germany has also been investing large portions of its own money into helping out the Greeks.  Their motive is simply self-preservation in the sense that, as the Eurozone&#8217;s strongest economy and lead exporter, its fate is invested in the rest of Europe&#8217;s success.  A double-dip recession in Europe, sparked by a Greek default, would especially hurt Germany as its exports would dramatically drop.  Germany needs strong trading partners, and any default would only serve to weaken trading ties within the Eurozone and European Union.  A default would also hurt Angela Merkel and her Christian Democratic Union party due to it being taken as a political defeat.  As such, Germany will continue to work for the unity of Europe and try to avoid a Greek default.

But Germany is not the only country to pay attention to.  Instead, we must also take a look to China, a nation that is becoming increasingly important in global economics.  China has an estimated $800 billion worth of Euros in its reserve.  This makes China very worried of the possible collapse of the Euro as a currency.  Also, the value of the Euro itself only needs concern about its future to lose value, a truth that has become very evident throughout currency markets over the last eighteen months.  China, due to this concern and due to the unstable price of the Euro, has offered monetary help to the Eurozone.  This is important for Europe, as it shows that their problem is a global one, and not simply continental.  It also allows China the opportunity to increase its global economic power, especially considering the fact that the United States is too concerned with domestic economic problems to help out in Europe.

The Eurozone is in a deep fix, but Germany and China are wanting and able to help.  But even here in the United States, we must worry about the problems in Europe.  The global economy is too interconnected to simply ignore it.
