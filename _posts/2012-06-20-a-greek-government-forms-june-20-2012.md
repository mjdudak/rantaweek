Greek leaders were able to successfully form a coalition government after days of negotiations that followed [Greek elections last weekend](http://rantaweek.com/greek-election-results-june-17-2012/ "Greek Election Results – June 17, 2012").  New Democracy, a center-right party, won the highest percentage of the vote and will lead the coalition.  New Democracy&#8217;s leader, Antonis Samaras, will become the new Prime Minister.

New Democracy will partner with two other parties to form this coalition: Pasok and the Democratic Left.  Both of these parties are further to the left than New Democracy, but all three are still pro-bailout.

Anti-austerity and anti-bailout party Syriza was not announced as a member of the coalition, but its leader did make it clear that Syriza would play the role of a vocal opposition.  Originally, Pasok said that it would not enter into any coalition that did not include Syriza, but this ultimatum was not followed through with.

An interesting thing to note is that the Democratic Left did not need to enter the coalition.  New Democracy and Pasok alone could have created a majority in the Greek Parliament.  However, this majority would be very weak, with 152 of the 300 seats.  Including the Democratic Left strengthens the coalition by increasing the majority.

This new Greek government, without Syriza, means that Greece will continue its path to austerity.  Greece still is facing a frightening array of economic problems, but hopefully this government will have the capacity to improve Greece&#8217;s future.
