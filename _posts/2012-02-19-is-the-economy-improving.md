For many, the economy is heating up once again.  The unemployment rate has fallen from a scary 10% in 2009 to a more comfortable 8.3% based on January&#8217;s numbers.*  President Obama is counting on an improving economy to boost him to reelection this November.  It makes sense that voters with newly found jobs may choose to reward the president with a boost at the polls.  That being said, 8.3% unemployment is still dangerously high.  Sure, it&#8217;s better than 10%, but for the economy to truly be considered healthy, unemployment should be much closer to 5%.  Millions of Americans are still out of work and desperately seeking for a job.  Unemployment numbers are getting better, but they must continue to fall in order to approach pre-recession levels.

The growth rate is another commonly cited statistic that is used to calculate the health of  an economy.  While it does not have any direct impact on individuals like the unemployment rate does, it does show whether or not an economy is making progress.  The growth in GDP for the 4th quarter of 2011 was estimated at 2.8%.**  This was considered by many to be a fairly impressive statistic.  It shows that we are clearly out of the recession, and that our economy is growing comfortably instead of shrinking.  But there is also a downside to this number.  While our economy chugs along at 2-3%, other economies have been growing by leaps and bounds.  Both China and India have been able to post growth rates around 10%.  These countries have demonstrated that they are better places for businesses to invest money due to their faster growth.  Even though the U.S. is growing, stronger growth rates in developing nations mean that in many cases, much needed capital will be headed overseas.  It is hard for the U.S. to compete when our growth potential is so diminutive compared to these nations.

Another important measurement is consumer confidence statistics.  Generally, the more confident consumers are, the more they will buy and the faster the economy will grow.  Using this metric,  we find some mixed data.  While the general trend over the last few months has been that things are improving, consumer confidence is still far from pre-recession highs.  One of the largest fears among consumers is instability.  Even for families whose economic situation has been improving, memories of difficult months during the recession still make for cautious buyers.  In many ways, this comes full circle as it connects with unemployment numbers.  Since many still feel that they do not have secure jobs, they refrain from making big purchases.  This also demonstrates that different sections of the economy are connected, and improvements in one section will give a lift to others.

So&#8230; is the economy improving?  The answer is a clear yes using any of these statistics.  Unemployment rates are down, growth has picked up since the recession, and consumers are starting to feel confident once again.  However, in each of these areas, we still have a long way to go.  It is impossible to simply call an economy &#8216;fixed&#8217;, but we do seem to be on the road to recovery even if we haven&#8217;t quite reached our destination.
