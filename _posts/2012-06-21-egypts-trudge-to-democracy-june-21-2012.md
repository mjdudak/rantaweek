Last month, after a [successful first round of the presidential election](http://rantaweek.com/egypts-political-divide-may-28-2012/ "Egypt’s Political Divide – May 28, 2012") in Egypt, it seemed as if things were really going in the right direction. Sure, the provisional military government had still overstepped its bounds, but once the runoff occurred, democracy in Egypt would ensue, right? Wrong. Several recent events have thrown Egypt back into turmoil and make it seem as if democracy is yet another step away.

As it turns out, after the [parliamentary elections](http://rantaweek.com/egyptian-elections-may-2012/ "Egyptian Elections – May 9, 2012") put the Muslim Brotherhood, an political Islamist party, in power, the supreme court, appointed by ousted president Hosni Mubarak, determined that the parliament was essentially void. Both the courts and the military claim to be for democracy and for change, but in reality both are leftovers from Mubarak&#8217;s age and are truly dragging their feet. Since the court declared this, the military once again claimed legislative power. Additionally, the military threw away the constitution created by the parliament and put together a 100-person panel to draft a new one. This panel will likely side more with the military and the court, which now leaves Egypt essentially under the control of a military junta.

This move demonstrates two clear currents in Egyptian politics. The first is that the military generals who control the government currently came into power wanting democracy. Then, after a while of having this power, much like Mubarak, decided that they really like that power and do not want to give it up. The generals have a unique position though; they are the only organizational entity, beside the court, that has it within their means to help set up a government. This means that they will likely eventually set up democracy, but they want to hold onto power for just a little bit longer. The second trend this demonstrates is the ongoing clash between the secular authorities and the Islamist politicians. While the Muslim Brotherhood had an overwhelming victory in the parliamentary elections, their candidate&#8217;s expectations in the presidential runoff was considerably less. Immediately after Mubarak was overthrown, the Muslim Brotherhood exemplified that rebellious, radical spirit that so many Egyptians thirsted for. Egyptians wanted change, the Muslim Brotherhood promised it. Now, however, Egyptians are starting to see a more reasonable change in the secular politicians. These two trends show that forming a government of democracy peacefully will be hard.

As if the mess with the Egyptian parliament is not enough, Egyptian election officials have also left the results of the presidential election up in the air. After the first round, the run-off came down to the Islamist candidate Mohamed Morsi of the Muslim Brotherhood and the secular candidate Ahmed Shafik, former prime minister under Mubarak. In all media, official and unofficial, it is clear that the votes indicate Morsi as the winner. What caused this delay is a mixture of factors. First, and most obvious is that the election officials work under the military government and were appointed by Mubarak. The military government does not want to lose its power.  Therefore, election officials cause a delay. Second, Shafik&#8217;s campaign has already filed complaints of election fraud by Morsi&#8217;s campaign. Whether this is a valid complaint or just a ploy is not immediately clear; however, based on first round results and the parliamentary results, Morsi&#8217;s success would not be a huge surprise. Third, and probably most important, is that the generals are holding back the results to dangle over the Brotherhood&#8217;s head. Currently, the Brotherhood refuses to accept the dissolution of the parliament, and the generals have vowed to not release the results, which will most likely name Morsi president, until the Brotherhood fully accepts the parliamentary dissolution.

And yesterday, as if things could not get any more complicated, there was a scare over Mubarak&#8217;s health. Although he is removed from power and in prison, many fear that the military will use his declining health as a way to let him free.

With all of these complicating factors in Egypt, the walk to the finish line of democracy will be murky, however, as is clear in the continued protests in Tahrir Square, where it all started, the Egyptian people will not settle for anything less. Egyptian people are truly getting military-fatigue and the junta needs to be out of power, yet with the dissolution of the parliament and the holding back of election results, it seems as if this will be a hard move. Egypt has lost most of its momentum in becoming democratic, but the will of the people still makes it chug on.
