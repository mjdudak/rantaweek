In 1961, at the height of the Cold War, in Belgrade, an organization called the Non-Aligned Movement, or NAM, was created. NAM&#8217;s central tenet was to not align themselves with or against any major power bloc. At a time when NATO and the Warsaw Pact dominated, many nations did not want to side, thus NAM was created. Yet, despite their attempt not to align themselves, NAM has summits regularly and issues declarations on where the member countries stand on certain issues. While many key players in the world are not members of NAM, the group is an organization of many developing nations. Made up almost entirely of South American, African, Middle Eastern and Asian nations, NAM often demonstrates the stance that the developing world has on an issue. Key members include India, Pakistan, Iran, Egypt, South Africa and North Korea. Beyond those countries, many consider NAM to be made up of a lot of countries that have very little influence in the global arena. Yet, on August 31sth, after meeting in Tehran, Iran, NAM issued the Tehran Declaration, a declaration that is very important, both in what it says and what it leaves out.

Arguably the most important part of the document is its statement on Iran. Forces in the west, primarily the US, have continually condemned Iran&#8217;s actions, not only in developing a nuclear program, but in continuing to [want to enrich uranium](http://rantaweek.com/irans-self-proclaimed-right-to-enrich-may-25-2012/ "Iranâ€™s Self-Proclaimed Right to Enrich"). Additionally, The UN Security Council demanded Iran halt uranium enrichment until it is made certain they are not seeking a nuclear weapon. Yet NAM took the entirely opposite approach. Not only did NAM defend Iran&#8217;s right to peaceful nuclear energy, but they backed Iran&#8217;s right to enrich, a claim that almost no one had agreed with until this time. While much of this had to do with Iran&#8217;s advantage on home turf, this also shows that most of these nations, including nuclear nations like India, Pakistan and North Korea, mostly have nothing wrong with Iran&#8217;s nuclear program. This may be for a number of reasons. The first may be that many countries see Iran&#8217;s nuclear program as perfectly peaceful, and have more faith in Iran not creating a weapon than the western world. The second may be that, even if they do see Iran getting a nuclear weapon, they may be okay with that, in order to balance out power in the Middle East with Israel. Whatever the reason, clearly NAM members see something in Iran that the western world does not. Given that many of these nations are closer allies with Iran than the west, they may turn out to be right.

Aside from what was stated in the Declaration, the other most important issue discussed at the meeting, and then not mentioned in the Declaration, was the issue of Syria. Initially, Iran was unwilling to try to garner support of Bashar al-Assad&#8217;s government. However, after [Egypt&#8217;s new president](http://rantaweek.com/in-egypt-a-consolidation-of-power/ "In Egypt, A Consolidation of Power"), Mohamed Morsi, surprised Iran by heavily criticizing Assad&#8217;s regime, Iran tried to lobby support for his regime. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei even struck an indirect blow to Morsi, possibly alienating Iran from Egypt, and many other NAM members. Yet in the end, Iran did not get their way, and there was no mention of Syria in the Tehran Declaration. Yet it is fairly evident that most members had their support behind the rebels more than behind Assad.

While the Tehran Declaration may not change anything in the immediate future, NAM acts as a window into the developing world, and gives a voice to many countries which do not normally get one. The consensus to allow Iran to enrich, while officially not agreeing on Syria shows what many, often outspoken nations, can and cannot agree upon. There is dissent in NAM, as in any organization, but NAM shows opinions that often go overlooked because of the dominance of the US, China, Russia and Europe. While those nations will continue to dominate international relations, more attention should be paid to NAM in order to understand a greater consensus of the world.
