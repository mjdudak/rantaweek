This past Monday, Mitt Romney and Barack Obama met for the final presidential debate, moderated by Bob Schieffer. This round&#8217;s topic: domestic- er, foreign- policy. Yes, the debate came off as more of another domestic policy debate than foreign policy. As the election is truly heating up, and things are getting close, this debate could have been make or break. Instead, we had an incredibly boring debate with little new ideas presented, and no policies beyond what is already in the political stump speeches laid out.

At the onset of the debate, with a good discussion on the Libyan embassy issue, things seemed fine and dandy. Or at least, as much as they can when talking about such a grave issue. In the ensuing discussion over various parts of the Middle East, it seemed as if American foreign policy may have just entered a new era. With both candidates agreeing on not allowing another war, using diplomacy and mulitlateralism, both candidates came off as centrist and realistic. This was progress.

Yet, when forced to look back 20 months to the Tahrir Square protests, and Hosni Mubarak&#8217;s presidency in Egypt, things began to fall apart. Both candidates began to talk about the economy. And what started as a valid point about having domestic stability before concerning ourselves too greatly with foreign policy slowly devolved into a repeat of the two previous presidential debates and every speech given by the candidates. While the US populous does admittedly care more about domestic, specifically economic, policy at this point in time, this was a foreign policy debate, and seeing this level of divergence was a bit off-putting. When the candidates where asked an essential question, &#8220;What is America&#8217;s role in the world?&#8221;, one which should force the candidates to put a unified face on their foreign policy, the candidates once again simply talked domestic policy. The one connection between domestic policy and foreign policy that was made for much of the rest of this part of the debate was primarily military spending; Romney argued to increase military spending while cutting the deficit by cutting spending elsewhere. Romney essentially claimed that our Navy is the smallest it has been since 1917. In perhaps the most memorable line of the debate, responding to Romney&#8217;s claim to boost military spending, Obama said &#8220;Governor, we also have fewer horses and bayonets.&#8221; After a long discussion about primarily the Middle East, Scheiffer turned the debate towards one of the most important geopolitcal powers- no, not Russia as Romney would allege, but China. Once again, both candidates expounded upon this opportunity to tout their domestic policy and destroy the other&#8217;s.

After discussing only a small handful of countries, including China, Iran, Syria, Libya, Pakistan and Afghanistan, the debate was over. What started as progress, and a true discussion of foreign policy eventually devolved simply into both candidates making contrived connections to domestic policy, saying nothing that has not been said on the campaign trail since the conventions and earlier. There was no true winner here, but the true loser was any fan of foreign policy. Especially in ignoring key issues like the Eurozone debt crisis and Mexican drug cartels, any foreign policy fan got shortchanged. While the general public cares very little about this topics, Schieffer did nothing unexpected and therefore nothing to truly challenge the candidates. In all, this was a very disappointing and predictable debate; no new ideas were presented and no surprises came out. In all, this debate will likely have very little impact on the election as a whole. In the next two weeks leading up to the election, polls will likely remain close, but on election night, it will all come down to a few key states.
