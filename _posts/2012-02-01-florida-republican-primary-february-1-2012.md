As the polls came to a close in Florida, Mitt Romney had exactly the win he was hoping for.  Beating out his closest rival, Newt Gingrich, by 14 percent, Romney was able to demonstrate his campaign&#8217;s continued strength.  It was a needed victory, as last week Romney suffered an embarrassing loss to Gingrich in South Carolina.  But there are more primaries to come, and Romney&#8217;s remaining opponents refuse to accept defeat.

Ron Paul, who finished in fourth place with 7% of the vote, certainly fits under the banner of someone who refuses to give up.  Paul remains too ideologically off-base to garner enough support for a serious shot at the nomination.  However, his persistence will continue to effect the race.  Paul has noted that, even if he does not win the nomination, he will leverage his delegates at the convention this summer in order to compel the Republican Party at large to listen to some of his ideas.  While this may or may turn out to be successful, it does tell us that Ron Paul plans to stay in the race long-term, and that he will continue to steal an important segment of voters that both Romney or Gingrich might otherwise be able to take.

Rick Santorum managed to garner nearly twice as many votes as did Paul.  However, his total is still dwarfed by both Gingrich and Romney.  In addition, his campaign is not well funded enough to strongly compete with the two more well-financed candidates on a national level.  Santorum&#8217;s popularity has dwindled as the race has moved on from Iowa.  While Santorum was able to rally the evangelical vote in Iowa and ride these votes to a win, this strategy has only worked for Iowa, and the Christian right he appeals to is a less substantial voter bloc in other states.  Santorum, like Huckabee in &#8217;08, was able to succeed in Iowa but has found trouble elsewhere.

Gingrich, however, seemed to thrive in South Carolina, where he surmounted Romney&#8217;s lead in the polls and was able to pull off an impressive victory.  Unfortunately for him, his poll numbers are rarely constant, and they soon dipped back down in time for the Florida vote.  Romney&#8217;s win in Florida does not spell doomsday for Gingrich, though.  After all, Newt Gingrich has turned the political comeback into a rather common occurrence this election season, and he still has the finances to be a serious threat to Romney in future states.  Gingrich had a disappointment in Florida, but saying that he does not have a chance at receiving the nomination would be naive.

Romney was the big winner, and his healthy margin of victory proves his campaign&#8217;s strength.  Florida also demonstrated that Mitt Romney&#8217;s tax returns have not made the huge dent in his popularity that many people believed would start to drag him down in the polls.  Instead, Romney has emerged from Florida as, once again, the clear front-runner.  Still, he has in no way become the inevitable choice.  Gingrich is still strong enough to give him a run for his money.

The main statement that should be made about Romney&#8217;s win is that it shows his strength in a crucial election state come November.  For the last 40 years, the candidate who has won Florida in the general election has gone on to claim the White House.  The voters in Florida seemed to respond well to Romney, and this could spell bad news for Obama in November if Romney does become the nominee.  A still-painful housing market in Florida increases Obama&#8217;s problems.  If Romney can present himself as a better candidate to fix economic problems like housing, he may be able to take this important state.

For now, Florida has spoken resoundingly for Mitt Romney&#8230; but no one is ready to call it quits yet.
