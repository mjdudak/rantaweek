Problems within Greece are nothing new, and we&#8217;ve [discussed them before](http://rantaweek.com/ode-on-a-grecian-bond/ "Ode on a Grecian Bond- November 20, 2011").  However, recent debt problems have sparked new fears that the eurozone is no longer willing to deal with the costly problem of continuous Greek bailouts.  Instead, many now seem ready to accept the consequences of a Greek default, hoping that this default will ultimately have less devastating consequences than the alternative, which is continuing to give Greece money even though no real fixes to their economic woes are being made.  Neither of these options are an easy way out, but the conversation has now turned towards which of the two paths will be followed.  Since the possibility of a Greek default seems higher than ever, it is best to discuss the possible effects of such an action.

Many think that a Greek default would be paired with Greece leaving the eurozone.  After all, other eurozone nations fear that instability within their common currency could cause rapid devaluation of the euro if Greece does default.  As such, Greece may be pressured into reinstituting its old currency of the drachma.  While this would help other eurozone nations, it may spell even more trouble for Greece.  As a fledgling currency issued by a government known to have serious underlying economic problems, the drachma would devalue quickly and rampant inflation would result.  A nation&#8217;s currency is only as strong as the economy that backs it, as currency does not hold any underlying value.  Greece&#8217;s shaky economy would produce a shaky currency at best, and an unstable monetary system could doom Greece&#8217;s economy for many more years to come.

The natural response to hearing this bad news is to assert that Greece should keep the euro.  However, other European countries could line up against this proposition as it could damage their economies further.  Europe is still coming to terms with the ratings downgrade for a basket of European countries&#8217; bonds.  Even the fund devised to help loan money to troubled countries, the European Financial Stability Facility, was downgraded.  The fears of a default are sending streaks of panic across the continent, and countries do not want to see further instability in their country that they feel stems from Greece.  The currency debate all boils down to a question of whether it is a better idea to place the vast majority of economic consequences on Greece or to spread out the consequences amongst other eurozone nations.

This is a bit of an oversimplification, of course.  Even if Greece switches to the drachma before it undergoes a carefully structured default, other European nations will feel some ripple effects.  Years of buying Greek bonds means that other nations will take a loss.  Still, this is a better choice for many countries than continuing to bail Greece out indefinitely.

But what if Greece stays with the Euro, even while undergoing a default?  Other countries may be more affected by such an action, but Greece itself may not leave the default as crippled as it would with the drachma.  And a Greece on the mend could help the eurozone as a whole.  After all, even under the drachma, close ties with euro users mean that Greece&#8217;s problems will continue to, in various ways, affect the eurozone.

Default is also not inevitable, as European leaders may still decide that the vague consequences of a Greek default are a worse alternative than continuing to provide loans.  All that we know as of now is that Europe faces a frightening array of problems, and each choice leaders make will only cause new fears.  Still, action must be taken, as Greece and other nations have underlying debt problems that will only worsen if not fixed.
