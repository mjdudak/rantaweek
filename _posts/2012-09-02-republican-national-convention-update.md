With Hurricane Issac essentially cancelling its first day, the Republican National Convention in Tampa got off to a rocky start.  But following several stirring speeches by up-and-coming Republican leaders such as Chris Christie and Marco Rubio, the party was still able to make its point clear.

The overall message was cleverly constructed: President Obama&#8217;s ideals have been ineffective and costly, so it will take a businessman to make government more effective and less wasteful.  Republican leaders also tried to humanize Romney, who has often had trouble connecting with voters on a personal level.

On the last night of the convention, Romney himself took to the stage, accepting his nomination in a speech that focused on both his family&#8217;s humble beginnings and on establishing a contrast between himself and President Obama.  However, the real attention grabber of the convention&#8217;s last night turned out to be Hollywood icon Clint Eastwood.  Eastwood&#8217;s sublimely unusual speech involved him talking to an imaginary Obama in an empty chair as well as having the crowd join him in saying &#8220;Go ahead, make my day&#8221;, the famous quotation from his film _Dirty Harry_.

While some pundits expressed opinions that Eastwood&#8217;s antics could have a harmful effect on Romney&#8217;s campaign, the attention created by the incident seems to be more humor based than political.  After all, even though Romney&#8217;s speech may not have been the most memorable of the night, he has still received a &#8216;convention bounce&#8217; of support.

But this convention bounce occurs with most candidates, and President Obama will likely receive one from the Democratic National Convention this week.  In order to see the final impact of the conventions on polling data, we will have to wait and see if the Democrats can erase Romney&#8217;s gains.

Still, a boost in support is not the only thing Romney leaves the RNC with.  As [RantAWeek has previously explained](http://rantaweek.com/for-obama-no-news-is-good-news/ "For Obama, No News is Good News"), Romney was barred from spending certain campaign funds raised for the general election before the convention officially made him the party&#8217;s candidate.  With this stipulation behind him, Romney will be able to more effectively counter Obama&#8217;s advertising campaign.  Considering that Romney has been out-fundraising Obama, the true effectiveness of his monetary resources still remains to be seen.

The election is still two months away, but in such a close race, these conventions matter.  To complete our coverage, we&#8217;ll we back with an analysis of the DNC next week.
