Rick Santorum, in light of the focus on Obama&#8217;s healthcare reform this week, has stepped up his criticisms of Mitt Romney.  On one level, this makes a great deal of sense.  After all, Romney&#8217;s healthcare reform in Massachusetts laid the foundation for Obama&#8217;s national-level reforms.  Since most Republicans were and are against Obama&#8217;s reforms, Romney has already been facing harsh criticism by many within his own party.

However, by increasing the severity of his criticisms against Romney, Santorum has been putting himself in a difficult position.  Looking ahead, the possibility of him winning the nomination has transformed from a long-shot hope into a nearly unfathomable proposition.  Santorum&#8217;s campaign needs to think about the risk versus the reward of their actions.  Criticizing Romney may win Santorum a few convinced voters, but it would be smarter for him to start making amends with the Romney campaign.

The reason for all of this is that even though Santorum seems to be an unfeasible presidential hopeful, he would actually make a feasible vice-presidential candidate.  Romney&#8217;s moderate positions, which can win over independent voters for the general election, would be well matched with Rick Santorum on the ticket in order to gain votes from conservatives who might otherwise not be motivated to vote for a candidate who they feel does not support their values.  As Mr. Santorum criticizes Romney, he opens up ideological differences between Romney and himself that start to make voters question the authenticity of a Romney-Santorum ticket.  It makes much more sense for him to focus his criticisms on President Obama, in effect smoothing the transition between the primaries and the general election.

This vice-presidential gossip does not mean that I think Rick Santorum will fill Romney&#8217;s VP slot.  (Indeed, I think there are several better VP choices.)  Still, Rick Santorum could be a valuable tool for Mr. Romney in the general election no matter how he is used.  And if Mr. Santorum wants to have any hope of a position in a possible Romney administration, he would be wise to start playing nice.

At the end of the day, this is all political talk, and if Mr. Santorum has proven anything this election season, it is that he is running as much of an ideological campaign as he is a political one.  And yet, he would do well to stop looking ahead to the near-impossibility of  his nomination, and instead keep his possibilities open.
