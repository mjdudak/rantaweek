With just about two weeks to go until the election and many polls showing a close race, both candidates are looking for positive momentum to carry them through the final stretch.  An easy place to obtain this momentum is through the final presidential debate, which will occur Monday night at 8 P.M.  RantAWeek will be welcoming our extended panel for our final debate liveblog starting at 8 P.M. Central.  We hope to see you there!
