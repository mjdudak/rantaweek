Back in [April](http://rantaweek.com/letting-loose-a-pressure-valve-in-iran-april-16-2012/ "Letting Loose a Pressure Valve in Iran- April 16, 2012"), negotiations between Iran and the western world started up for the first time in over a year. Yet the only true outcome of this meeting was an agreement to meet again in May. Well, the meeting took place this week, and once again, the only tangible outcome was an agreement to meet. Granted, this is a step in the right direction, but because tensions are increasing constantly, steps to truly come to an agreement need to be completed, and soon.

The primary point of disagreement is Iran&#8217;s &#8220;right to enrich,&#8221; something virtually invented by Iran that no other country has ever recognized. Over the past 40 years, almost every country in the world, including Iran, has signed a treaty, called the Treaty of Nuclear Non-Proliferation, which details how to prevent nuclear weapons from falling into any more hands. The idea is that there are five countries (China, France, United Kingdom, Russia and the United States) that openly posses nuclear weapons, and that is enough. Any other country will not be allowed to posses nuclear arms of any sort. However, with this comes an obligation of those nations to help other nations develop &#8220;civilian nuclear energy programmes.&#8221; Iran has taken this definition and expanded it to a &#8220;right to enrich.&#8221; No country denies Iran&#8217;s right to peaceful, civilian nuclear energy, however Iran&#8217;s right to further enrich their nuclear programme is contested by most. The fear with this enrichment is that Iran will get to weapons-grade Uranium and create a nuclear weapon. Going into the talks, nations knew that Iran has enriched to about 20%, which is a level at which weapons can be make, but they are generally ineffective. Iran claims that they can continue to enrich the Uranium if they so wish, not to create weapons, but rather for medical technologies. Meanwhile, the west mostly denies this claim.

While Iran refuses to give in without being granted a &#8220;right to enrich,&#8221; the west refuses to give in without Iran giving up all future nuclear development. Officially, these talks have nothing to do with nuclear weapons, simply nuclear enrichment. Unofficially, these talks revolve entirely around Iran pursuing a nuclear weapon. These unofficial accusations have basically been called blasphemy by Ayatollah Ali Khamenei&#8217;s, the leader of Iran, supporters. These supporters have said that because of Khamenei&#8217;s Islamic faith, he could not create nuclear weapons as they would be sacrilegious. The west still does not buy into it.

Recent talks between Iran and the west proved relatively uneventful. The only thing that came out of them is what will be the primary point of contention: the right to enrich. Iran clearly claims they posses this right, and have even flaunted in. Merely a day after the talks ended, the International Atomic Energy Agency, the UN&#8217;s nuclear watchdog, has found that Iran has enriched Uranium to 27%, a level higher than anyone previously thought. Clearly, this shows that Iran has the capability to and will continue to enrich until they agree not too. And because this is their primary request in the talks, it seems unlikely that they will give up this right.

Therefore, with Iran&#8217;s economy spiraling more and more downhill as the oil embargo starts to set in and as they get closer to a weapons-grade Uranium stock, tensions will continue to rise. With the talks bearing no fruit, the world can wait and hope that the talks scheduled for June in Moscow will be more successful. It is clear that an agreement needs to be reached, and soon. Otherwise, there is a lot more at stake than simply an economy or enriched Uranium.
