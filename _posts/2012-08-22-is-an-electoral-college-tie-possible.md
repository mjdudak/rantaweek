America&#8217;s electoral system allows for an interesting anomaly: a tie.  With 538 electoral votes possible, each candidate can win exactly 269, preventing either from winning the majority needed to clinch the presidency.  The Constitution specifies that if this is to happen, the House of Representative selects the President.

So an electoral tie is possible, but since the Republicans are likely to maintain control of the House of Representatives, it would almost certainly result in a Romney presidency.  However, just because something is possible mathematically doesn&#8217;t mean it is convenient electorally.  In order to determine what a tie would look like this election season, it is best to only look at swing states, and assume that the candidates will win their safe states.

What are the swing states?  We first defined our swing states [in this article](http://rantaweek.com/the-electoral-college-doing-the-math-april-27-2012/ "The Electoral College: Doing the Math") back in April, but some updates are needed.  In June, we took the Republican victory in the [Wisconsin recall election](http://rantaweek.com/wisconsin-elections-walker-and-the-presidency/ "Wisconsin Elections: Walker and the Presidency") as a sign that Wisconsin is in play for Romney.  And considering that Wisconsin Representative [Paul Ryan](http://rantaweek.com/paul-ryan-how-romneys-vp-impacts-the-campaign/ "Paul Ryan: How Romney’s VP impacts the campaign") is now on the G.O.P. ticket, Wisconsin should most definitely be added as a swing state.  Additionally, bad polling in Arizona for President Obama means that Arizona should no longer be considered a swing state and instead given to Romney.  These changes leave us with the swing states shown in white below:

Unfortunately, the work does not end here.  We must make a few more simplifying assumptions.  Of these swing states, North Carolina has leaned towards Romney.  While it is certainly conceivable  for Obama to win North Carolina, the upset victory there would most likely come with victories in the vast majority of other swing states, giving Obama a win and ruining the possibility of a tie.  The same is true for Pennsylvania, but with Romney being the underdog instead of Obama.  Thus, we will award Pennsylvania to Obama and North Carolina to Romney before looking at ties.  The electoral map now looks like this:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2538" title="Swing States minus NC PA" src="http://rantaweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Swing-States-minus-NC-PA.png" alt="" width="595" height="455" srcset="http://rantaweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Swing-States-minus-NC-PA-300x229.png 300w, http://rantaweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Swing-States-minus-NC-PA.png 595w" sizes="(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px" />](http://rantaweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Swing-States-minus-NC-PA.png)

Using these eight swing states, there are four cases in which an electoral tie can be reached.  All four require a Romney win in Florida, but the other seven states go to different candidates based on each case.

**Case 1: Romney wins Virginia, Colorado, Nevada and Iowa.  Obama wins Ohio, Wisconsin and New Hampshire.**

This case is unlikely due to the fact that Romney has been polling much better in Ohio than he has been in Nevada.  Thus, it is naive to expect a defeat for Romney in Ohio coupled with a win in Nevada.

**Case 2: Romney wins Ohio, Nevada, Iowa and New Hampshire.  Obama wins Virginia, Wisconsin and Colorado.**

**Case 3: Romney wins Ohio, Wisconsin and Nevada.  Obama wins Virginia, Colorado, Iowa and New Hampshire.**

Both Case 2 and Case 3, just like Case 1, face a Nevada problem.  Romney has been polling better in Colorado than Nevada, meaning it is unlikely that he will win Nevada but lose Colorado.  Luckily, Case 4 solves this problem, having Obama win Nevada.

**Case 4: Romney wins Ohio, Wisconsin and Iowa.  Obama wins Virginia, Colorado, Nevada and New Hampshire.**

** **This case is much more feasible than the other three simply because it has Romney winning the easiest states for him to win.  Most polls show Obama&#8217;s lead to be rather shaky (or non-existent) in Ohio and Iowa, making it easier for Romney to win their electoral votes.  The one trouble is Wisconsin, which has leaned more to the left than either Ohio or Iowa over the past few years.  However, due to the influence of Paul Ryan&#8217;s Wisconsin roots, a Romney victory in Wisconsin seems more feasible than it did before the VP selection.  Unlike the other three cases, Case 4 presents a fairly logical electoral breakdown, leaving us with this map:

Remember, while this map makes logical sense electorally, there are a plethora of other maps that make similar sense.  This is not a prediction for how the Electoral College will turn out, this is merely a prediction for what a possible electoral tie would look like.  If you have any questions, critiques or predictions of your own on this matter, please feel free to share in the comments below!
