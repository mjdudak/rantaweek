Economics have been a large focus of this [election season](http://www.onlinecolleges.net/2012/10/10/20-eye-opening-open-courses-for-election-season/), but Americans often become too caught up in domestic policies to accurately compare the U.S. economy to the rest of the world.  For this reason, we are often surprised at our low rankings on the world stage.  This infographic from [OnlineBusinessDegree.org](http://www.onlinebusinessdegree.org/2012/10/12/world-economic-freedom/) helps to draw some comparisons.
