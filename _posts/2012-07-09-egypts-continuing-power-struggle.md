Egypt&#8217;s newly elected president Mohammed Morsi has made an aggressive political decision by calling Egypt&#8217;s Parliament to re-assemble.  Just weeks ago, the Parliament was dissolved by Egypt&#8217;s Supreme Court in a move that many viewed was an attempt to cement the military&#8217;s hold on power.  Both the most powerful judges and the military elite are holdovers from the days of Mubarak, and their attempts to maintain power threaten the viability of Morsi&#8217;s new government.  As Egypt&#8217;s first democratically elected president, Morsi has the responsibility of successfully transitioning Egypt out of the army&#8217;s clutches and making it a fully functioning democracy.

Morsi&#8217;s call to reconvene the Parliament can be viewed as a direct challenge to the military leaders.  In this respect, his actions make sense.  After all, both he and the Parliament have been elected to serve Egypt.  The military leaders, being unelected, should in no way hold power over the legislature.

However, Morsi&#8217;s call is also in direct opposition to the Supreme Court.  While often assumed to be aligned with the military in blocking democratic efforts, the court is still important for the functioning of Egypt&#8217;s government, and Morsi has partially voided its legitimacy by attempting to overrule its decision.

The underlying problem with these events in Egypt is that Egypt no longer has a constitution to provide checks and balances to its separate branches of government.  Morsi&#8217;s action may be criticized for having no basis in law, but any action can be criticized as illegitimate when there is no supreme law of the land.

When the Supreme Court disbanded the legislature, the army assumed legislative powers.  Mr. Morsi, by reconvening the Parliament, is giving legislative powers back to elected representatives.  Additionally, the first step to creating a functioning constitution is to have a democratically elected voting body.

Mr. Morsi is creating legitimacy for his government.  While the army&#8217;s reaction is not yet known, an overruling of a Mubarak-tainted Supreme Court seems acceptable if the end goal is to create a working and stable democratic system.
