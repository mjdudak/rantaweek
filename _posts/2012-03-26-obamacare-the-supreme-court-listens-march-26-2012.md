The Supreme Court, most days, does little to affect the average American citizen.  Many Americans feel passionate about politics and the direction that the country is headed but rarely stop to think about the Supreme Court.

Such complacency leads to surprise when the power of the Court is revealed.  Landmark decisions such as Marbury v. Madison, Plessy v. Ferguson, Brown v. Board of Education and United States v. Nixon have forever shaped our country.  Attention has once again turned to the Supreme Court, as the ultimate fate of President Obama&#8217;s healthcare reform rests in its hands.  Oral arguments are this week, but a final decision may not be made for months.

Even with the ultimate verdict months away, many are asking whether or not the court will declare the law unconstitutional.  However, this is not an easy question to answer.  Supreme Court decisions are rarely clear before they are announced.  If the decision was easy or obvious, a lower court could have decided the issue.  Plus, the sheer complexity of the case, including hundreds of pages of legislation and regulations, complicates things for even the most experienced prognosticators.

More complicated still, if it finds fault with the law, the court does not necessarily have to call the entirety of the reform unconstitutional.  By picking a specific part, such as the requirement for states to expand Medicaid programs, and declaring it unconstitutional, the court could leave the law partially intact while taking out offending components.  Of course, the Supreme Court can still take the all or nothing route: upholding the constitutionality of the entire bill or effectively killing  all of its components.

Still, it is important to note that even though the oral arguments are this week, the Supreme Court&#8217;s decisions do not revolve solely around these arguments.  I had the opportunity a few weeks ago to participate in a question and answer session with the Honorable Antonin Scalia, and I asked him about the relative importance of oral arguments in the final verdict for a case.  He answered by saying that while an extraordinary oral argument can sway his opinion, his final conclusion is more often reached through deliberations on the case briefs.  Apparently, Supreme Court decisions do not follow _Miracle on 34th Street_ processes.

But what exactly are the justices deliberating on?  The question boils down to whether or not this healthcare overhaul fits under Congress&#8217;s authority to &#8220;regulate commerce&#8230; among the several states&#8221;.  This so-called Commerce Clause, straight from the Constitution itself, gives the federal government the power to regulate interstate commerce.  The question becomes whether or not the changes under the new healthcare law fall under this statement and whether they are &#8220;necessary and proper&#8221; to regulate the healthcare industry.

It may seem like a pointless technicality, but this ruling will set the course for the future of healthcare within the U.S.  Moreover, due to the timing of the verdict, which will be announced in the middle of an election year, this case will also have political consequences.  Both Republicans and Democrats have turned the healthcare debate into an important election issue.  But at the end of the day, political parties have no say in the Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling.  Like us, all they can do is wait.
