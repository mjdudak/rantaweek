It has been a double-win of sorts for Romney.  While he only edged out Rick Santorum in Iowa by the smallest of margins, his win helped to assert his campaign&#8217;s dominance and solidify his lead nationwide.  This success was only furthered by his much more comfortable lead that he won in New Hampshire on Tuesday.  However, Romney had been considered a shoe-in to win New Hampshire, and other campaigns largely ignored the state.  The battleground that they have now settled on is South Carolina, where the campaigns have started a war of words and a slew of advertising.  The campaigns of Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul and Rick Santorum understand that they need to stop Romney&#8217;s momentum before his campaign gains enough power and funds to seal the race in his favor.

Unfortunately for them, Mitt Romney has a slight lead in current polls for South Carolina.  Romney is also helped by the fact that he has won the endorsement of South Carolina&#8217;s governor.  It would seem like Mitt Romney will inevitably triumph over his rivals in South Carolina, but, while he is the favorite, the other candidates are hardly willing to give up.  If anything, the knowledge that South Carolina might be their last shot to take down Romney has invigorated the rival campaigns and their criticisms of Romney have become more harsh and more pointed.  And especially after Rick Santorum saw a surge in popularity in the last few days leading up to Iowa, it may be best to expect the unexpected.  Any of the other candidates can still see one of the rapid rises in the polls that have become so common this election season.

That being said, Romney still has the clear upper hand. Even though his opponents are using advertising attacks to try and hurt Romney&#8217;s support, Romney still has the largest fundraising take and his campaign is in the best shape financially.  Santorum and Gingrich may be able to dump a few million on advertisements in South Carolina, but they will have little money left over for possible future contests in states that are more expensive to advertise in, specifically Florida.  On the other hand, Romney can trump the other campaigns&#8217; spending totals while still having money left over for future contests.

Mitt Romney is currently leading the polls, and the perennial front runner has successfully become the only front runner.  But that does not mean that we should disregard everyone else.  South Carolina is an important battle, but the other campaigns are not willing to surrender yet.
