The 17 month old Arab Spring Rebellion in Syria reached a turning point Wednesday when a bombing attack killed both the Defense Minister and President Bashir al-Assad&#8217;s brother-in-law.   The rebels, who are often viewed as being disjointed, proved that they have the ability to target influential individuals who are close to Assad.

But in the case of this bombing, the location is just as important as the targets.  Occurring in the Syrian capital of Damascus, the rebels were able to attack Assad where he should have been the strongest.  Nascent organization amongst the rebels, especially through the Syrian National Council, has been increasing, meaning that the rebellion is providing a more unified opposition to the Assad regime.  Partially for this reason, the Red Cross has declared the conflict in Syria an official civil war, which helps to legitimize the rebel organization.

The rebels may have shown their increasing power by staging an attack in Assad&#8217;s stronghold, but that is no guarantee the rebels are strong enough to eventually beat Assad&#8217;s forces and take control of the government.  If anything, it represents the latest stage in an ongoing escalation of the conflict.  Rebels have managed to obtain military supplies from across the Turkish border, and Assad has likely been [receiving weapons from Russia](http://rantaweek.com/russia-and-syria-june-13-2012/ "Russia and Syria").

Still, if the rebels now have the ability to target powerful individuals in Damascus, Assad is likely to lose the support of some of the Syrian elite.  Direct clashes between the rebels and Assad&#8217;s forces will most likely only lead to a bloody war of attrition.  However, by stirring unrest through the ranks of Assad&#8217;s most powerful supporters, the rebels may have a chance to undermine Assad&#8217;s regime and weaken his grip on power.

The rebels in Syria have made a bold attack, but they must now work to continue their attempts.  One dent is not enough to collapse Assad&#8217;s government, and yet it is most certainly a step in the right direction.
