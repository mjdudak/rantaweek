After just over a week of bloody fighting, on Tuesday, the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas and Israel enacted a ceasefire. Prior to the cease-fire, tensions had erupted in Hamas shooting rockets into Israel, Israel countering with airstrikes. The cease fire stopped what was expected to escalate into a full-on ground invasion of Gaza by Israel. While the cease-fire will save lives on both sides, the actual terms of it are very shaky, but still have a broad ripple effect.

The primary implication comes from the fact that these two groups are finally able to behave diplomatically. So often, when these two are trying to negotiate something, they simply turn their heads and refuse to even talk. Yet this time, both sides were able to sit down and, with much US and Egyptian coercion, eventually reach a deal. This demonstrates a positive step forward for diplomacy. There was an omnipresent fear that the situation would eventually devolve into a second Gaza War, similar to the one in 2008. Yet leaders on both sides were eventually able to reach an agreement, and this is a good thing.

Beyond just the implications for the relations between the two sides, it highlights a tempering of Hamas. Rather than turn to Syria or Iran as it has so many times in the past, Hamas opted for more stable, more moderate allies, primarily Egypt, Turkey and Qatar. This demonstrates an attempt by Hamas to gain regional and international legitimacy and become a more reasonable power. Much of this can be attributed to the fact that there is a growing sense of disunity within Palestine. The Palestinian Authority (PA) and Hamas have both been struggling with who actually controls Palestine, but Hamas has long been too extreme for the PA to actually work with. By becoming more reasonable, it is much more feasible that the PA and Hamas can present a unified front, representing the needs of Palestinians.

Furthermore, a key aspect of the cease-fire was that Israel will finally loosen its grip on goods and people moving in and out of Gaza. For a long time, Israel has essentially shut down all movement to and from Gaza, leaving Gaza in a very poor state, with unemployment hovering around 30%. But by opening borders, even just a bit more, Gaza may become more economically stable, allowing it to stabilize as a whole. By doing so, Hamas may be tempered even more as the Gazan people start to experience a ever-so slightly standard of living. This opening of borders may actually be mutually beneficial for Israel and Palestine.

Finally, this cease-fire represents a big shift in regional power. Egypt has always been a key player in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but with this recent bout of negotiations, it is evident that they will quickly become the most important player. Egypt has a vested interest in relative peace between these two. Egypt does not want to upset Israel because Israel has threatened to just dump Gaza on them, while they do not want to upset Hamas because of a sense of shared culture. Egypt wants a relatively equal peace, one which favors neither side. Additionally, this shift towards Egypt demonstrates a weakening of other regional powers in this conflict, primarily Turkey. For a long time, Turkey was a key player simply because they too wanted relative equality. Recently however, relations between Turkey and Israel have become very cold, making Turkey overwhelmingly pro-Hamas. Further, Egypt&#8217;s new prevalence may allow the United States to step out of the situation a bit. The United States&#8217; close partnership with Israel has lead to an alienation of many Arab states, and while they will not give that up any time soon, taking a more hands off approach may thaw relations with these states. These negotiations demonstrate that as it is now, Egypt is perhaps the only country in any sort of position to truly be the mediator between Hamas and Israel; this may be a good thing.

The exact terms of this cease-fire have yet to be sketched out, yet the implications of it are broad. The implications are positive for all sides of the conflict. The ability to sit down peacefully, a more temperate Hamas, greater economic stability in Gaza and Egypt&#8217;s growing role will benefit all involved. By creating a mutually beneficial cease-fire, a more compromising peace process in the future will be greatly facilitated.
