After months of media speculation, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has finally selected his Vice Presidential pick in Paul Ryan.  Ryan, a Congressman from Wisconsin, is considered a rising star of the G.O.P.  As the Chairman of the House Budget Committee, Ryan has become an influential economic policymaker within Republican ranks.  His focus has consistently been long-term financial stability through spending cuts, a platform that has gained him Tea Party support.

Examining all of these qualifications, Ryan seems to be a sensible counterpart to Romney.  Ryan&#8217;s focus on increasing America&#8217;s long-term economic viability melds well with the Romney campaign, which has [focused on economic issues](http://rantaweek.com/presidential-slogans-2012/ "Campaign Slogans: Obama and Romney").  Additionally, Ryan&#8217;s conservative fiscal policy and Tea Party support will help Romney with a Republican base that has been wary of his moderate stances.  Young and passionate, Ryan brings new excitement to the Republican ticket, as so far Romney has struggled to excite voters.

However, being young may also be one of Ryan&#8217;s weaknesses.  Only aged 42, Ryan has served for over a decade in the House of Representatives but lacks any executive experience.  Still, considering Obama&#8217;s lack of experience in 2008, it is unlikely that the Obama campaign will tailor criticism of Ryan towards his youth.  But that does not mean Ryan will be safe from Democratic criticism.  His budget plans have previously been berated by Democrats, who have considered some elements to be an attack on social programs such as Social Security and Medicare.  If Obama&#8217;s team can convince voters that Ryan&#8217;s influence would endanger these programs, Ryan could become a liability to Romney.

Even though Ryan has his detractors, Romney is betting that Ryan&#8217;s positives will outweigh the possible negatives.  And one big positive that comes with Ryan&#8217;s selection is a better standing among Wisconsin voters.  Polls in Wisconsin have slightly favored Obama, but native son Ryan should give Romney a boost in the polls there, bringing [Wisconsin&#8217;s ten electoral votes](http://rantaweek.com/wisconsin-elections-walker-and-the-presidency/ "Wisconsin Elections: Walker and the Presidency") back into play for Republicans.  Electorally, this makes Ryan a better pick than Sarah Palin was four years ago.  Palin was from the solid Republican state of Alaksa, meaning that McCain was almost guaranteed to win the state even without her help.

That being said, Palin and Ryan were chosen for many similar reasons.  Both relatively young, they were chosen as an exciting and youthful counterpart to relatively staid presidential candidates.  Both relatively conservative, they were chosen as a lock on the party base, allowing their moderate running mates the ability to target independent voters without alienating mainstream party values.

Ryan, however, will be unable to attract women voters like Palin did in 2008.  Many polls have shown Obama trouncing Romney among certain demographics of female voters.  It may be up to the potential First and Second Ladies to help the Republican ticket&#8217;s standing with female voters, as Ryan brings nothing new to the table.

While Ryan is not Romney&#8217;s perfect choice for VP, it is important to remember that no pick would be perfect.  Ryan has weaknesses, but also has strengths that could help propel Romney to success come November.  The election season has entered a new phase, and Paul Ryan will play a key role in determining its outcome.
