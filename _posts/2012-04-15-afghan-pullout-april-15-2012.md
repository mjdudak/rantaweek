American troops are trying to get out of Afghanistan as soon as possible. Not only do a majority of people in the US want to pull out regardless of how prepared they are, but Afghanistan seems ready for us to leave as well since NATO has caused more trouble than previously anticipated. For example, in January, American soldiers were recorded urinating on the Taliban fighters they had killed. Then, pictures emerged of Americans burning copies of the Koran in a garbage pit. Not only was all this embarrassing and avoidable, it has also caused protests all over Afghanistan, where many were killed or injured. On March 11<sup>th</sup>, an American army staff sergeant killed seventeen innocent civilians after suffering from severe mental problems. It is no surprise that more and more people in both countries are becoming critical about US involvement in Afghanistan; NATO could only apologize for the trouble we have caused.

As a result, the general agreement is to finish our responsibilities quickly and leave. In an effort to swiftly eradicate the Taliban, night raids led by US officials were established. These night raids consisted of troops breaking into homes in search for insurgents and were very unpopular among most Afghan citizens because the troops did not need search warrants to forcibly search through personal property. But the US insists on continuing them, claiming that they are the only way to find out enough information in order to capture Taliban commanders. Since the US usually gets what they want, the American-led raids continued.

Recently however, control over special operations missions, including night raids, was given to Afghan forces to expedite the transition of military charge over to the government. Even though Hamid Karzai’s political popularity has fallen since these night raids, the president has no other choice but to conform because Afghan troops still need American aid most of the time. One good thing that has come out of this transfer of authority is that the US no longer needs to worry about handling captured Taliban members. Instead of directly dealing with these prisoners, the US must teach forces in Afghanistan to respect human rights because evidence revealed that some of the detainees were often tortured while under Afghan custody. By doing this, American troops can take a break, Afghan security forces will improve, and the transfer of Afghanistan’s military power may run more smoothly in the future.

Although US aid in Afghanistan has led to a variety of unnecessary troubles, we have still done a fair job in helping Afghan forces get back on their feet. Some of our actions may be controversial, but hopefully, after teaching Afghan troops to become independent and establishing a secure foundation for the future, the United States can safely pull out of Afghanistan.
