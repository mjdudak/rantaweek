    After the Republican National Convention in Tampa, President Obama and the Democrats made their case for a second term in Charlotte, North Carolina.

Political tradition dictates that the party in power holds their convention second.  This is considered an advantage, as the better timing allows for a rebuttal against the points brought up at the other party&#8217;s convention.  Attempting to take advantage of this, the Democratic Convention painted Obama in a much more positive light than the [Republican Convention](http://rantaweek.com/republican-national-convention-update/ "Republican National Convention Update") the week before.  Additionally, Democrats tried to shift blame for the slow economic recovery away from the executive branch and towards Republican leaders in Congress.

As far as speeches went, the Democrats lacked a speech as arresting (or controversial) as Clint Eastwood at the RNC.  However, former president Bill Clinton, in one of the DNC&#8217;s most talked about speeches, gave an impassioned defense of Obama&#8217;s presidential record.  Clinton focused on a variety of economic statistics that showed both Obama&#8217;s strengths in addition to potential weaknesses in Republican policies.

When Obama himself took the stage Thursday night, he focused on similar topics, touting his own record while criticizing Republican-proposed ideas.  Still, his speech represented a marked transition from earlier speeches at the 2008 and 2004 Democratic Conventions.  Of course, this was expected.  Obama&#8217;s prior convention speeches had focused on his desire to drastically change the political dynamic.  As an incumbent facing partisan gridlock and a sluggish economy, such optimism would be misplaced.  While Obama&#8217;s speech on Thursday remained optimistic, it focused on a simpler objective to continue moving &#8216;forward&#8217; &#8211; his campaign slogan.

Obama&#8217;s confidence in the nation&#8217;s recovery was tested just hours later when the August jobs report was released.  In a stroke of luck for the Democrats, the unemployment rate decreased to 8.1%.  The harsh media attention from any increase in unemployment would likely have stymied any positive momentum Obama gained from the convention.

But even though the unemployment rate did drop, a deeper look at the numbers presents a less cheery picture.  The economy added 96,000 jobs in August, down more than 30% from the 141,000 jobs added in July.  Even more scarily, the 96,000 jobs do not fully correspond to the .2% drop in unemployment.  In fact, 96,000 jobs only corresponds to about .06% to .07% of the total civilian labor force.

Why then did the unemployment rate drop more than the numbers would imply?  The answer is due to the fact that the unemployment rate only includes individuals who are actively seeking work but can not find it.  As RantAWeek has [previously pointed out](http://rantaweek.com/the-untold-story-of-high-unemployment/ "The Untold Story of High Unemployment"), this makes the unemployment rate sensitive to workers leaving the work force.  In recent economic times, workers who decide to leave have often been discouraged from their inability to find a job.

Still, Obama has a good headline of the unemployment rate dropping.  His post-convention momentum will likely remain intact.  But an improving unemployment rate does not necessarily correspond to an improving employment scenario.
