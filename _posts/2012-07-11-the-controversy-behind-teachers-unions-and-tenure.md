[Wisconsin](http://rantaweek.com/wisconsin-elections-walker-and-the-presidency/ "Wisconsin Elections: Walker and the Presidency") Governor Scott Walker supported a controversial plan to curtail teachers&#8217; collective bargaining rights.  The Illinois legislature has debated pension reform that could increase costs for teachers, prompting many heated discussions on the issue.  RantAWeek believes that in order to understand the debate, having knowledge of the history behind the controversy is crucial.  As such, we are delighted to share this infographic from our generous contact at [Best Colleges Online](http://www.bestcollegesonline.com).
