Earlier this week, Aung San Suu Kyi, the leading opposition voice in Myanmar, was allowed to start her campaign to run for a seat in the legislature.  Many hailed this as a step forward for the country, also known as Burma, that until last year was run solely by a military junta.  The United States surely feels that Myanmar is moving forward, as the U.S. government has just normalized relations with the formerly estranged country.  However, in many ways, Myanmar is only painting a picture of change, and in looking beyond the facade observers are able to see that Myanmar&#8217;s fundamentals are little changed.

Myanmar&#8217;s government itself, while no longer officially ruled by the military junta, is still heavily under the influence of the same leaders.  As the junta disbanded, many of the same leaders stayed in their legislative seats.  So while Myanmar has technically opened up to democracy, many of the same people still hold power.  And even though Aung San Sui Kyi and other opposition members are now allowed to run for office, they are competing for a tiny minority of seats in the legislature.  No political change will come of any elections, and even though Suu Kyi enjoys widespread popularity, she will remain little more than a false promise of change.  A seat in the legislature means little if former military leaders can simply outvote her attempts for change.

Another way to view Myanmar as exagerating its &#8216;democratic&#8217; improvements is through its partial release of political prisoners.  As part of its efforts to make government free and fair, the government released hundreds of political prisoners.  However, they still have a majority of their opposition behind bars or under house arrests.  As Myanmar&#8217;s government still holds these hundreds of opposition members under close scrutiny, there is simply no way to call their country a democracy.  Sure, some steps have been made, and it is a good thing that Myanmar is beginning to open up to the rest of the world.  Still, small improvements in the country&#8217;s human rights record do not make for a sudden turnaround, and Myanmar still has a long way to go.  The old leaders from the military junta must pass completely from power before a real democracy can be created.
