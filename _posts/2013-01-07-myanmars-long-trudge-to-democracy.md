<span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">It&#8217;s been awhile since we<a href="http://rantaweek.com/skeptical-victory-for-democracy-in-myanmar-april-9-2012/"> have discussed</a> Myanmar, a country often hailed as the last frontier for democracy, so it seems like an apt time to do an update on their circumstances.</span></span></span>

<span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Currently in Myanmar, they have made great strides towards democracy. Economic liberalization and opening up to the world will likely improve the economic situation in Myanmar. In recent months, sanctions have been lifted, and all around, trade barriers between Myanmar and especially the US have been lowered. Improving the economic situation improves the standard of living for Burmese, which, in turn, makes them more vocal for more reform. As Myanmar’s natural resources are used and their workforce grows, Myanmar will begin to move its way up the value-added chain, and as with most economies, economic growth will bring more democracy. The economic situation in Myanmar is looking up, and will likely kickstart a cycle for more economic and democratic reform.</span></span></span>

<span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">As for the political situation in Myanmar, it too is quickly improving. With the cabinet reshuffling, the administrative side of things in Myanmar will begin to open up as new, fresh faces bring new, fresh ideas with them. Additionally, the parliamentary elections that took place last year began the reform, and as more seats are opened up to the National League for Democracy, the Union Solidarity and Development Party will be forced to continue reforms in order to even have a chance at staying in power. This means that either way the politics fall, both parties will ensure that reform is continued. Yet without a new constitution, the military still may have the opportunity to come back into power. But given the military general’s support for Thein Sein and his reforms, this seems unlikely.</span></span></span>

<span><span><span><span style="font-size: small;">The biggest problem plaguing Myanmar today is the Rakhine state. Essentially, in the Rakhine state, there is an oppressed minority of Rohingya Muslims. The Buddhist Rakhine in this area have continued violence against the Rohingya, killing, raping and burning down their houses. Currently the Rohingya remain a country-less people as Myanmar does not accept them, forcing many refugees to Bangladesh where they are also not accepted. In Myanmar, they are not even given the rights of basic citizens. The government, however, has remained fairly silent. If the government says anything, it is always in favor of the Rakhine, and the military in Myanmar has made things worse for the Rohingya. To make matters worse, the Rohingya are not receiving aid, as the Rakhine and military block it, and countries like Bangladesh have stopped sending it. Even other Muslim countries have remained silent despite the immense bloodshed As long as Aung San Suu Kyi  Suu Kyi has already reached out to every other minority, now is her opportunity to reach out the Rohingya. If she can do this, the biggest stumbling block toward democracy will be taken out. Yet because Suu Kyi still faces a Buddhist electorate, it seems unlikely that she will try to get much done until possibly she has seized the presidency.</span></span></span></span>

<span style="color: #333333;"><span style="font-family: Georgia, 'Times New Roman', 'Bitstream Charter', Times, serif;"><span style="font-size: small;">Myanmar is on a long trudge toward democracy. They have come far, but still have far to go. At this point however, with economic and democratic growth already occurring, it seems unlikely that Myanmar will reverse track anytime soon. There are still many obstacles, including the Rakhine state, a remaining large military influence and corruption, but with the help both internally and externally, the last frontier for democracy may be conquered.</span></span></span>
