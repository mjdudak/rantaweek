Going into the first debate on October 3rd, President Obama was enjoying a comfortable lead in the polls and the bad press Mitt Romney was still receiving for his 47% comment.  It seems natural that his best strategy was to play it safe, as his advantageous situation made risky attacks both dangerous and unnecessary.

The president did indeed play it safe, but was perhaps not expecting Romney to be as aggressive as he was.  Ultimately, Obama chose not to refute many of Romney&#8217;s attacks.  His passivity, coupled with Romney&#8217;s well placed aggression, led many observers (including our [liveblog](http://rantaweek.com/live-blogs/october-3rd-presidential-debate/ "October 3rd Presidential Debate") panel) to declare Romney the winner.  However, what first appeared to be a small rhetorical victory has morphed into a large-scale polling shift.  While Obama was clearly leading before the debate, Romney has taken the lead in many polls collected afterwards.

This should not shift the perception that Obama is the favorite and Romney is the underdog.  A spike in the polls is meaningless if it is not long lasting.  And while this spike has also occurred in state polls, the shift in many key swing states has not been enough to clinch leads for Romney.  National polls are important, but unlike state polls, they can be tricky to adjust to the Electoral College.  After all, the presidential election is won state by state, and in an election this close national polls can be misleading.

Additionally, the news cycle has been favorable for Romney, and a solid jobs report that should have been good news for Obama was lost in the coverage of the recent swing in the polls.  The Obama camp is in a considerably more precarious situation than it was before the first debate.  The Democrats have lost their positive momentum, and it is now up to Joe Biden to recover it in the vice presidential debate Thursday night.

A win for Joe Biden and the Democrats will likely curb the Republicans&#8217; positive momentum and bring some stability back to the polls.  However, if Paul Ryan is the big winner of the night, the news cycle may continue to favor the Republicans.  This positive coverage could help the Romney ticket cement its gains in the polls

But while Romney faced a passive Obama, Ryan should not expect the same from Biden.  The Democrats learned their lesson last time, and Biden is likely to be much more aggressive than Obama was in his first debate.

Even though the vice presidential position is often lampooned for its limited governmental role, all political eyes will be on the VP candidates Thursday night.  Joe Biden and Paul Ryan will control the news for the next couple days, and with polls as close as they are, their contributions may make all the difference.
