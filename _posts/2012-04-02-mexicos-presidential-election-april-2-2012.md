2012 is not just election year in America.  We&#8217;ve discussed upcoming elections in [Burma](http://rantaweek.com/change-in-myanmar-perhaps-january-19-2012/ "Change in Myanmar, Perhaps – January 19, 2012") and [France](http://rantaweek.com/french-presidential-race-the-anti-sarkozys-febuary-27-2012/ "French Presidential Race: The Anti-Sarkozys- Febuary 27, 2012"), but now it is Mexico&#8217;s time in the spotlight.  Current President Felipe Calderon, of the National Action Party, is not allowed to run again under constitutional term limits.  Still, even if he were allowed to run, Mr. Calderon would have a hard time winning, as his widespread unpopularity means that people will not be sorry to see him go.  A controversial and violent drug war has smeared his record.

But Mexican voters seem hesitant to pin the blame solely on their president.  Due to the unpopularity of the current administration, the National Action Party has also been hurt in the polls.  National Action Party candidate Josafina Vásquez Mota has found it difficult to separate her candidacy from the bad name of her party.  She has campaigned with the slogan &#8216;Different&#8217;, but to many voters, this is nothing more than an empty promise.  After all, Vásquez Mota has served as an insider in Calderon&#8217;s administration.

Another choice, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, belongs to the Party of the Democratic Revolution.  This party can be considered a third party in Mexican politics, but it does hold some regional power.  However, it&#8217;s limited power nationally means that López Obrador will have slim odds of winning the election.  Still, he does hold power in the fact that his campaign will draw votes away from the other candidates, especially because Mexican presidential elections do not involve runoffs.

While López Obrador and Vásquez Mota are trying to win the support of the Mexican public, the current front-runner is Peña Nieto.  The former governor of the State of Mexico, he is a well known name in Mexican politics.  The fact that his Industrial Revolutionary Party is powerful nationally has helped him gain widespread popularity, especially because his stance as a member of the non-ruling party means that he can more effectively use the promise of change while campaigning.

The only person who has managed to hurt Peña Nieto&#8217;s campaign so far has been Peña Nieto.  His gaffes have caused voters across Mexico to give the other candidates a second chance.  In his most famous gaffe, he was unable to name a single book that had influenced him and was forced to stall until he weakly decided on the Bible.  Still, Peña Nieto has the lead in polls for now, but as for winning the election, _Del dicho al hecho, hay un gran trecho._  Loosely translated to English: it&#8217;s easier said than done.
