[<img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-2469" title="Monedas argentinas" src="http://rantaweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/monedas_argentinas-300x172.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="172" />](http://rantaweek.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/monedas_argentinas.jpg)In 2001, the world experienced its largest ever sovereign debt default. After a long, 2-year downward spiral, Argentina finally decided they could no longer afford to pay off their debt. Yet, after several years of recovery under Nestor Kirchner, and after his passing, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, Argentina has started to get back on its feet. Yet, recently the International Monetary Fund cut predicted growth in Argentina from 8.9% last year to 4.2%, a huge drop. Clearly, Argentina&#8217;s economy is beginning to suffer. Given that many were thinking Argentina might soon become an economic powerhouse and could rival Brazil if it continued its growth, this is a significant drop. And with it, many are wondering what is the boogeyman responsible for economic slowdown. Most signs point to inflation.

In a healthy economy, 4-6% inflation is good, it means the money supply is expanding fast enough that the economy as a whole can expand. Yet Argentina is dealing with inflation on a massive scale. Currently, inflation on the peso is at about 9.9%, something incredibly devastating for its economy. This high inflation is creating a number of ripples throughout the Argentinian economy. The most important is Argentina&#8217;s inability to establish a domestic market. While exports in any economy are good, a domestic market creates a stable economy, one which can continue its growth and development. However, in Argentina, because of their high inflation, Argentinian citizens have trouble buying goods, foreign or domestically produced. Their money is simply losing value at a rate that makes it almost impossible for Argentinians to truly consume. Additionally, Fernandez is doing nothing to alleviate this. Fernandez has continually levied barriers to trade in Argentina in an attempt to make Argentinian goods more competitive on the domestic market. This has had some positive benefits, as many corporations, which already invested in Argentina, have built factories and tried to produce more goods in Argentina. Yet, in doing so, Fernandez has also made goods more expensive, simply because there is less competition on the market.

But poor policy does not stop there. Recently, Argentina passed legislation which expands powers of the central bank. Yet the expansion of these powers is primarily to help fund the treasury, which is greatly in debt. But in funding the treasury&#8217;s debt, the central bank is also pumping even more money into the economy, thus creating even more inflation. Because of poor policy choices, coupled with already high inflation, a domestic market in Argentina has greatly suffered and has therefore stagnated its economy.

Clearly, Argentina is in a bad position economically. High inflation destroys the possibility of establishing a solid domestic market. And because the rest of the world economy is still trying to recover, with even leading developing nations [beginning to slow](http://rantaweek.com/the-export-buffer-why-the-chinese-and-indian-economies-have-slowed/ "The Export Buffer: Why the Chinese and Indian Economies Have Slowed"), Argentina cannot depend on any one else to buy Argentinian goods and revive its economy. In order to continue Argentina&#8217;s path toward an established economy, Fernandez must stop making the kinds of monetary and trade decisions she has, and tackle the issue of inflation. Tackling the inflationary boogeyman is the only way that Argentina can ensure not to head down the same path as in 2001.
