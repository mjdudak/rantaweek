The fledgling nation of South Sudan is the perfect example of a country desperately in need of foreign investment.  After all, with plenty of oil, South Sudan has the resources to grow a sustainable economy.  However, they lack the infrastructure to export those resources.

These infrastructure woes are where China enters the picture.  Using its monetary and industrial strengths, China has worked to create a rudimentary infrastructure in South Sudan and other African nations facing similar problems.  By doing so, China is offering the promise of development in exchange for increased exposure to Africa&#8217;s oil and mineral resources.  African nations are clearly accepting these terms, as China is now Africa&#8217;s largest trading partner.

The relationship makes sense.  Africa gets much needed infrastructure and China gets the raw materials its developing economy depends on.  But it is not without its drawbacks.

China&#8217;s policies are often easy to criticize, and its actions in Africa are no exception.  Africa is notorious for having corrupt leaders, and many onlookers have claimed that China is unjustly using a corrupt system to exploit the continent&#8217;s resources without much benefit to the majority of Africans.  The idea behind this claim is that, by giving legitimacy to less-than-democratic African leaders, China&#8217;s promises of development for these African nations will only benefit the privileged classes.

However, the argument that China&#8217;s actions are mere exploitation is flawed.  Beyond merely investing in resources and the infrastructure to securely export them, China has also built schools and hospitals for struggling areas.  Additionally, goods produced in China are generally cheaper than African goods, making products easier to buy for African consumers.

But those cheaper goods are a double edged sword.  While they lower the cost of living in many areas, the entrance of these foreign goods into the African marketplace undermines local sellers.  Artisans simply can&#8217;t compete with the strength of the Chinese economic machine, hurting local businesses.  Additionally, Chinese companies have often brought Chinese workers to Africa instead of hiring locals.  Even though some jobs are being given to Africans, Africa always has a need for more employment.  Africa has a young workforce that in many cases is expanding faster than the market can create jobs.  If China really cares about Africa&#8217;s economic future, they will do more to tackle the problem of widespread unemployment.

The issue of employment also brings up the issue of labor rights.  Chinese companies have been accused of allowing workers to toil in unsafe conditions for low pay.  While these companies may wield the political influence to avoid many consequences of infringing on labor rights, they are beginning to make some Africans wary of Chinese involvement in their continent.  If China is trying to build the foundation of a long-lasting and stable trade partnership, it should pay more attention to these opinions.  Resentment is not the basis for good trade.

At the end of the day, however, China&#8217;s ability to provide infrastructure improvements is needed by many African nations.  While some aspects of the increased trade this has resulted in seem to be a double edged sword, Africans and Chinese alike should hope for improved policies in the future.  If trade is a two way street, both China and Africa need to be satisfied with the outcome.
