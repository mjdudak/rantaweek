Last week, the world lost a true visionary in Steve Jobs. For those of you who know me, you know I have never been fond of Apple. My reason for this is simply that it will not do what I want to do. But Steve Jobs realized that he did not have to market to everyone, only to the masses. I am not your average electronics consumer, I am a programmer and hardware enthusiast, but I am a minority. rather than cater to those like me at first, as many technology companies did, Jobs noticed that other people might be drawn to use computers and electronics, if only they could figure out how to use them. There was a large learning curve associated with using technology. For enthusiasts, this learning curve was well worth it, but most people could not see over it to see the advantages. But Jobs did something revolutionary, and did it well: he lowered this learning curve. He made devices that were as close to dead-simple as anyone got and also made them beautiful.

When watching Jobs keynote, you see him use words like &#8220;magical&#8221; to describe aspects of devices. This word choice is poked fun of by many, but the word seems fitting. In all of his systems, there are levels of abstraction in place that make it hard for someone to comprehend what is happening at the lower levels. But these levels of abstraction are what make it easy to use and beautiful. These levels make it so that you do something as you would expect to, and somehow it does what you want it to. When it does this, it acts &#8220;magical.&#8221; The levels of abstraction act like a magician&#8217;s cloak, making something seem truly magical just by hiding what is going on from your view.

With this &#8220;magic,&#8221; Jobs has acted as a major catalyst to jump start the consumer electronics industry. Jobs made what was a niche industry to appeal to the masses, allowing the development and growth of this industry to what it is today.

While the death of Steve Jobs does not make me any more fond of Apple, it does make me reflect to what Jobs has done for the technology industry as a whole. The technology industry is probably the industry that I personally appreciate most, without which the words that you are currently reading would not be here. The spread of the industry is great, and it&#8217;s impact on our life is undeniable. When examining the history of this industry, there are a few forefathers that one can point to as true visionaries. Amongst these, we have lost a man. Â However, the impact of this man lives on in every one of our daily lives. -MD
