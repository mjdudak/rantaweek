As the Prime Minister of Italy, Silvio Berlusconi has been through a lot.  He has maintained his post throughout numerous sex scandals and while combating legal issues, often barely surviving votes of confidence.  However, he has finally announced that he will be resigning after the passage of a series of economic reforms designed to help save Italy from becoming the next Greece.  And although he has not made any legally binding pact to step down as of yet and the commitment is solely verbal, Mr. Berlusoni&#8217;s words should be taken seriously.

One interesting piece of information from this news should be analyzed.  The fact that Berlusconi was able to survive harsh legal troubles and repeated scandals but ultimately succumbed to the politically wrenching E.U. debt crisis shows the seriousness of the issues E.U. leaders must face.  It also displays that Italians are willing to overlook ethical blunders of their politicians but have finally put their foot down when faced with the future of their economy.  Italy&#8217;s bond rates have risen drastically over a short time, and the government&#8217;s cost of borrowing is becoming too expensive for comfort.  For this reason, Italy may soon be pressured into accepting a bailout like the ones other troubled European countries have received.  There is no way to be sure of how Italian leaders will react to this.  One thing, however, is for sure, that Mr. Berlusconi will no longer have to make the tough economic choices that Italy will have to face in both the short and long term, but we can hope that his successor, Mario Monti, will rise to the challenge.
