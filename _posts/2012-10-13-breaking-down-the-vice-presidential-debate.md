**Moderation**

After the rather lackluster moderation of Jim Lehrer, with his obsession with &#8220;differences&#8221; [last week](http://rantaweek.com/a-change-in-polls-as-the-vp-debate-nears/ "A Change in Polls as the VP Debate Nears"), Martha Raddatz came out this week looking like a superstar moderator. Beginning with the fact that she was physically on the same level as the candidates, she was a more central part of the debate. Rather than allowing the candidates to take charge, Raddatz opened segments with broad questions, but then continually drilled the candidates to get specific answers. Raddatz made them debate, not give stump speeches. The one part where Raddatz could have taken a more active role was where Biden and Ryan were both citing different numbers about the same thing, essentially arguing about whose math was more correct. But as a whole, Raddatz very effectively drew the truth out of both candidates and was a good moderator.

**Style**

While many people in the US care deeply about the actual issues (we will get to those later), let&#8217;s face it, people care about style. Since 1960, how you appear in a televised debate matters. First, we will discuss Biden. Normally known as a self-sufficient gaffe-machine, Biden certainly did not bother to hold his tongue. He came out swinging, showing an aggression that Obama lacked last week. Yet, eventually it got to the point where Biden bordered on condescension. Chuckling and showing his toothy grin during many of Ryan&#8217;s statements, Biden seemed like he was simply hanging out with some buddies during the debate. Not to mention his continual use of the word &#8220;friend&#8221; to refer to Ryan.

Ryan meanwhile came off as much more composed, but almost to an off-putting degree. While Biden was full of fire, Ryan seemed very stoic and almost robotic. When he tried to sound sincere, he seemed not nearly as sincere as Biden. And while this may have turned many voters off, to many Ryan seemed much more knowledgeable and presidential. All in all, Biden seemed too comfortable, Ryan seemed to stiff. Stylistically, pick the lesser of two evils here.

**Issues**

The majority of the first volley of the debate had solely to do with foreign policy. Biden, being both the incumbent and seen as highly influential on Obama&#8217;s foreign policy basically paraded around in all of his foreign policy expertise and Ryan had a bit of a struggle to keep up. In this foreign policy exchange, Biden simply came off as much more knowledgeable and much more prepared, while Ryan seemed to struggle a bit to find his footing. However, soon the topic shifted to domestic policy. While this is something that should have played into Ryan&#8217;s hands since it dealt with key issues like the budget, social services and healthcare, in reality, much of this portion just became a jumbled mess. With Ryan, Biden and Raddatz all talking over each other and Biden and Ryan arguing over who had the better math, domestic policy made very little sense on either side. When things shifted to talking about Afghanistan, the debate came to an essential standstill. There is very little partisan disagreement over what to do in Afghanistan. When things turned to Syria, Biden once again seemed more knowledgeable and played to the sense of American war fatigue. Ryan also made an interesting comment that boots on the ground should only be used when it benefits American interests. From there, things took a very somber turn with a question about religion and abortion. Ryan essentially said he believes life begins at conception, while Biden said he agrees with the Catholic Church&#8217;s stance but does not want to impose that on others. Raddatz then asked an excellent closing question, forcing the candidates to look at their own campaigns and say how a veteran would respond to their campaign tactics.

**Impact**

In the end, it came out to pretty much a draw, with the winner being heavily dependent on what set of standards you use. In terms of just issues, because Biden was able to talk more about foreign policy and his expertise, he simply came off as more knowledgeable. However, in this debate, style played a big role, and many will likely look at Biden as too condescending, while Ryan seemed much more composed. On the other hand, Biden seemed much more aggressive at the same time. All in all, it truly depends on how you look at it, but the debate will likely help the Obama campaign recover from Obama&#8217;s seeming lack of preparation and aggressiveness.
