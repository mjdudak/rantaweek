**Format**

Wednesday night&#8217;s debate employed a new format in which the candidates had a longer time to both explain and defend their positions.  Positively, this allowed for the candidates to go more in depth than the usual campaign soundbites.  It should be considered a good thing that a presidential debate delves into such issues as the impacts of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform Bill.  We hear surface-level rhetoric all campaign long, and specifics are a rare blessing.  But while both candidates cited ample amounts of statistics to back up their claims, the dueling statistics had the side-effect of making the discussion often turn to a debate on the veracity of the other candidate&#8217;s claim.  Mitt Romney, perhaps realizing this war of numbers was occurring, had this to say:

> &#8220;Now you cite a study.  There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it&#8217;s completely wrong.&#8221;

Still, dueling statistics are better than dueling platitudes, and the new format successfully allowed a civil discussion of important issues.  Even numbers that the opposing candidate questions are better than no numbers at all.

**Moderation**

Let&#8217;s be honest, moderator Jim Lehrer got cut off.  A lot.  As much as the new format allowed for a more in-depth discussion of the issues, it also made the candidates less accountable for going over time.  Jim Lehrer tried to tell the candidates their time was over, but often failed to stop them from continuing.  At one point, Lehrer told Obama his two minutes were up, but received this in reply:

> &#8220;No, I think I had five seconds before you interrupted me.&#8221;

Obama continued making his point, and talked for much longer than five seconds.  The time inaccuracies added up, and Obama&#8217;s cumulative speaking time was considerably longer than Romney&#8217;s for the vast majority of the debate.

**Issues**

While both candidates tamed their attacks, Romney seemed to edge Obama out on the war of rhetoric.  Romney brought some new explanations to the table when talking about his proposed policies.  While Obama tried to bring some relatively new proposals into the discussion, Americans are already well versed with most of his policies.  Thus, Obama sounded trite whereas Romney sounded fresh.

Also interesting was that Romney appeared to move his rhetoric to the center.  While he governed as a moderate Republican in the traditionally liberal state of Massachusetts, Romney has espoused many conservative opinions so far on the campaign trail.  As an appeal to independent voters, this move made a lot of sense.  Romney&#8217;s poor position in the polls going into the debate proved that he can not solely rely on his base to win.

Romney also took a more combative tone towards Obama.  While both argued their respective stances well, Romney was able to more successfully put Obama on the defensive.  Not only did this happen with the actual verbal argument, but it also happened physically.  Romney often spoke facing Obama, whereas Obama rarely looked at Romney while speaking.

**Impact**

****The general consensus in our [liveblog](http://rantaweek.com/live-blogs/october-3rd-presidential-debate/ "October 3rd Presidential Debate") last night was that Romney won.  However, Romney did not win a landslide victory.  Considerably behind in current polls, Romney needs a great deal of positive momentum.  His strong performance last night may help him a little, but he is unlikely to regain all of his lost ground.  Obama&#8217;s goal last night was to play it safe, and even though this tactic may have hurt his debate performance slightly, Obama should not expect to receive a large scale punishment in the polls.

Romney may have won the battle, but Obama remains slightly ahead overall.  Still, with three debates to go, there is still some time for Romney to play catch up.
