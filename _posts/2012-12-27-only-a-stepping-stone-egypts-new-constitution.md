Egypt has spent a nearly two year long transitional period lacking a Constitution to gauge the legality of its leaders&#8217; actions.  But now, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi has signed the country&#8217;s new Constitution into law.  Such an action might make one believe that Egypt&#8217;s unstable transitional days are over, and that the country is now headed for a stable and democratic future.  Unfortunately, that unchecked optimism is unwarranted, and Egypt&#8217;s new Constitution is only a stepping stone on the path to creating a stable democracy.

The first obstacle Egypt&#8217;s constitution presents to creating a stable democracy is its inclusion of sharia law as a foundation for Egyptian law.  While moderate Islamist government is not by principle undemocratic, the incorporation of this fundamentalist Koranic doctrine into Egyptian government is too vague to give citizens a clear understanding of what religious laws they are bound by.  Without clearly differentiating the boundary between religious rules and democratic freedoms, the new Constitution fails to define the extent of democracy in the new Egypt.  The gray area this creates has already proven itself to be dangerous through the response to the controversial _Innocence of Muslims_ video.  This inflammatory video denigrated Islam and broke Koranic law, but also was protected under the basic democratic tenet of free speech.  The video ignited widespread protests in Egypt, and although Morsi was able to eventually calm the protestors, the incident serves as a first chapter in Egypt&#8217;s struggle to reconcile democracy and Islam.  Unfortunately, the Constitution has not solved this conflict and in fact has only exacerbated it by sparking new tensions.  Egypt still faces an uncertain future in regards to the limits of religion in government.

Additionally, the public vote on the Constitution demonstrates both distrust and apathy towards the new government.  While the Constitution was passed in a nationwide referendum with an impressive 64% of the vote, less than one third of eligible voters cast their vote.  Considering that the very legal structure of the country was at stake, the apathy of most Egyptian voters serves as a disheartening surprise.  Morsi can claim public support for his Constitution from the fact that it passed, but the underlying voter apathy shows that the mood in Egypt is far from enthusiastic about Morsi&#8217;s policies.

Worse still, the Constitution has come under heavy criticism for failing to protect Egypt&#8217;s women and minorities.  64% of voters may have approved the Constitution, but that leaves 36% who voted against the document.  This latter group has served as a very vocal opposition, and many of their concerns are both valid and unanswered by the Egyptian government so far.  After all, how can a Constitution that uses Islamist law as foundation for national law protect the rights of Egypt&#8217;s large Coptic Christian population?  Opponents of the Constitution have followed this line of questioning, but Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood have been hesitant to provide concrete answers.

But all this negativity directed towards Egypt&#8217;s constitution does not mean the country is doomed to instability forever.  While many obstacles still remain, it is important to remember that many of Egypt&#8217;s problems have been encountered before.  The &#8216;vagueness&#8217; of Egypt&#8217;s Constitution mirrors that of many other constitutions.  Even America&#8217;s Constitution needed a Bill of Rights to include the basic freedoms many have argued Egypt&#8217;s Constitution ignores, as the original draft of the U.S. Constitution lacked the freedoms of speech and religion.  Voter apathy may be unexpected for such an important vote, but many democracies have learned that large segments of the public simply don&#8217;t care.  Minorities haven&#8217;t won their protections yet, but many other democracies have taken decades to extend full rights to all citizens.  Egypt&#8217;s new Constitution may have problems and may only be a stepping stone towards stability, but at least Egypt is taking a step in the right direction.
