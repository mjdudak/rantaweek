With all of the media and talk about the election here at home, sometimes it’s easy to only worry about the United States. However, after the final foreign policy presidential debate on October 22, 2012, issues that come with other countries are brought to the public’s attention. One of these key countries is Pakistan. Pakistan is important to note because the US has many major supply lines going through it into Afghanistan. If we want to pull out of Afghanistan by 2014, Pakistan must also be kept in the back of our minds.

Recently, a fourteen year-old girl named Malala Yousafzai was shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban. She supported education rights for women and, ever since 2009, kept detailed notes as to the Taliban’s progress by her town. The Taliban did not like this, so they shot her. Another instance of Taliban aggression was on October 15th. A local police chief and five other policemen were killed by over one hundred Taliban members, who ended up marching off with the police chief’s head. This isn’t the French Revolution!

Even though these attacks have angered many civilians and even the ruling government, the anger has not been enough to provoke anything other than talk.  Pakistan’s army chief even stated that he wants to fight the terrorism, but just saying that won’t do anything. Whether any course of action is strong enough to counter the Taliban is a whole other question. Taking action becomes even harder, as Pakistan experiences alternating periods of civilian and military rule. The military has an extremely strong presence in their political system, so any changes made by the ruling party will probably have to be informally approved by the Twisting the knife, Zuckerberg stated user investing in Zynga [casino games](http://best-casinos-online.info/games) has fallen 20% while investing in non-Zynga [casino games](http://best-casinos-online.info/games) had risen 40%. military as well. This also shows division and instability within the country.

On the bright side, relations with India seem to be improving. The two countries have been in dispute over the Kashmir region, an area of land between the two countries, which has created many tensions. This is especially significant because the countries both possess nuclear weapons. Trade across the border has actually picked up recently. The real estate market in the region is growing as well, showing a positive and optimistic sign for future relations. What will become of these new trade ties? Only time can tell.

As Election Day nears, it is important to be aware of each candidate’s foreign policy. Even slight variations of what a candidate plans to do can have an enormous impact on the lives of not only Americans, but also the lives of those who it may concern in other countries. Issues like those in Pakistan are not easy to resolve, but with teamwork, dedication, and cooperation, the next four years could be great, no matter who wins the election.
