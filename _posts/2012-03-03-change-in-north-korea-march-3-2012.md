Rumblings of change are visible in the isolated nation of North Korea.  A new era commenced as soon as Kim Jong Un took control following the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, last December.  But even though a new leader is at the helm, American foreign policy concerning North Korea is just as complicated as ever.

To explain current happenings, it is necessary to provide some historical background.  For the last few years of Kim Jong Il&#8217;s reign, the country invested in becoming  a nuclear power, much to the discomfort of the United States.  As North Korea ramped up efforts to create missiles, other countries counterbalanced these plans with an offer to trade food aid for promises that the North Koreans would stop certain aspects of  their weapons programs.  Particularly desperate for food to feed his starving citizens, Kim Jong Il accepted this food aid.  Unfortunately, the promises to curb weaponry turned out to be empty, and nuclear tests continued.

North Korea, under the new leadership of Kim Jong Un, seems to be offering a similar compromise to the offers worked out under his father&#8217;s rule.  Leaders in North Korea have once again promised to stop enriching uranium and to prevent further weapons tests in exchange for much needed food aid from the U.S.

The United States takes this offer with a bit of skepticism, of course.   However, there is an optimistic side of things in the hope that the North Korean regime under Kim Jong Un will operate differently than the old regime.  Still, this sort of optimism is partially unfounded.  Even though Kim Jong Un is not Kim Jong Il, there is no specific policy-based reason that would make Kim Jong Un voluntarily give up the nuclear program his father so obstinately worked to create.

Still, it seems wrong to judge Kim Jong Un based on the misdeeds of his father, especially when the food aid could be a literal lifesaver for thousands of starving North Koreans.  In addition, American diplomats wish to use this deal, if successful, as a jumping board for future successes with North Korea.  The next planned leap would be the reorganization of the six-party talks, which were peace negotiations previously stalled by hostilities.  If participants were able to restart negotiations, they would have the goal to reach a larger compromise that would completely disable North Korea&#8217;s nuclear abilities.

It would make since that if the food aid/weapons concessions deal works as hoped, the achievement will display how Kim Jong Un is honestly willing to change his father&#8217;s policies and open his country to the rest of the world.  This success could easily be expanded to other endeavors such as the six-party talks.

However, by the same reasoning, failure to successfully execute this compromise could doom diplomatic relationships with the North Koreans for years to come.  If the United States has the ultimate goal of stopping North Korea&#8217;s military ambitions while also preventing the starvation of the hungry citizenry, this compromise will stand as an important first step in dealing with a brand new leader.  The danger of North Korea is often overlooked, but the recent accords offer a possibility of better relations.  This possibility is certainly worth an attempt of fulfillment by the U.S. government, even if the final outcome is uncertain.
