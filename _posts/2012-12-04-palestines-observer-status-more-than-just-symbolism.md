It seems like the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is one of those stories that is just [always in the news](http://rantaweek.com/cease-fire-in-gaza-resounding-ripples/ "Cease-Fire in Gaza: Resounding Ripples"). Yet, once again, we find them in the news. This time, after a failed bid for full United Nations statehood last September, Palestine filed for &#8220;Observer- State Status,&#8221; on par with the Vatican City. Unlike the full membership which was vetoed in the United Nations Security Council, observer status is up to the full general assembly. The resolution passed resoundingly, with the final vote being 138-9. But many on both sides of the debate are arguing about what this elevated status will actually be. Hopefully, it should speed up the peace process, and allow Israel and Palestine to finally hash out a peace plan.

The primary snag in peace negotiations has been borders. Israel continues to settle on Palestinian land, basically tearing down Palestinian houses and replacing them with Israeli ones. For this reason, Palestine refuses to come to the negotiating table with Israel, unless they stop. However, now, even though observer status is a largely symbolic move, it gives Palestine access to key entities including the International Criminal Court. The expectation is that should Palestine take Israel to the ICC for their settlements, Israel will lose. It is expected that Palestine will likely begin by threatening Israel to stop settling, or risk being taken to the ICC. Hopefully, this threat alone will deter Israel enough to force them to stop settlements. If Israel finally stops these, Palestine will once again be willing to negotiate.

Another main issue within Palestine has been a lack of unity. Hamas in the Gaza Strip and the Palestinian Authority (PA) in the West Bank (which also claims control over  Gaza) have been in a power struggle, and Israel refuses to negotiate with Hamas. Recently, after the attacks between [Hamas and Israel](http://rantaweek.com/cease-fire-in-gaza-resounding-ripples/ "Cease-Fire in Gaza: Resounding Ripples"), the PA suffered a set-back and came out as the less-legitimate entity. Yet now, with the PA the officially recognized head of Palestine, Palestinians will likely rally behind and support them. If the PA can gain increasing support, then Hamas will start to weaken, making negotiations better and for a less extreme Palestine. This is good for all entities involved.

Another telling factor is simply a shift in the global arena. For a long time, the Israel-Palestine issue divided the world. The east mostly supported Palestine, while the west mostly supported Israel. Yet in this vote, the 9 countries that voted against the measure included the obvious candidates, such as the US and Israel, and then a bunch of less important countries including Canada, Panama, Czech Republic, Marshall Islands and others. On the other hand, Palestine had the support of Spain, France and Italy all voted in favor of the resolution. 41 countries including Germany and the United Kingdom abstained from voting. Clearly, global support for Palestinian statehood is beginning to change. As the rest of the world wants Israel and Palestine to just call it quits, it is likely that they will.

With a combination of halted settlements, Palestinian unity and international pressure, hopefully both sides will be willing to cave a little bit and hash out a deal. The peace process has been one going on since the two states were separated 65 years ago, and will likely continue. However, observer status at the UN may do more to expedite the process than to slow it down.
