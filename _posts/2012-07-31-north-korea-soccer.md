While campaigning in 2008, Barack Obama paused his focus on domestic issues to take a world tour.  In doing so, he improved his foreign policy credentials and showed both himself and his message to be international phenomenons.

Based on Obama&#8217;s success, it makes sense that Mitt Romney would try a similar tactic.  But unfortunately for Romney, his trip has been tarnished by a series of gaffes.  In the U.K. he criticized the handling of the Olympics, leading to rebuttals from British politicians.  While in Israel, he hinted that culture was what made Israelis more economically successful than Palestinians.

However, Mr. Romney is not entirely to blame for the controversy.  The media is especially apt to pick up these gaffes due to a slow domestic news cycle.  With the Olympics dominating news, media outlets desperate for a change of topic capitalized on Mitt Romney&#8217;s verbal missteps.  Still, the timing itself is interesting.  Obama&#8217;s timing made sure that his trip did not have to compete with Olympics coverage.  Romney&#8217;s trip, on the other hand, faces this overlap.  Whatever positive news the campaign was hoping to receive likely would have been minimized by Olympic coverage.  And even with a diminished upside, Romney&#8217;s planning still left him with something to lose.  The press, after all, would rather report on embarrassing mistakes than an otherwise staid trip.

Still, chances of these specific gaffes influencing voters on election day are slim.  Instead of viewing this trip as a damaging mistake, it should more accurately be viewed as a failed opportunity.  Obama&#8217;s trip cemented his international standing and made him seem a ready diplomat, important successes for a candidate who was attacked about his inexperience with international matters.  Facing a similar problem with inexperience, Romney sought to boost his credentials with this trip.  But considering that Romney&#8217;s campaign is more heavily focused on domestic and economic issues, these international gaffes are unlikely to hurt his credibility.

Down in most polls, Romney must find some way to attract voters.  Poorly copying Obama&#8217;s 2008 strategy won&#8217;t win him the White House.  That being said, this misstep is hardly devastating.
