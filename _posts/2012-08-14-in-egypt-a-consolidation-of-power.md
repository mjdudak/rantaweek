Even though new President Mohamed Morsi was democratically elected this summer, Egypt has faced [a continuing power struggle](http://rantaweek.com/egypts-continuing-power-struggle/ "Egypt’s Continuing Power Struggle").  Army leaders in the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, also known as SCAF, have been reluctant to relinquish power.  After dissolving the newly elected Parliament, SCAF claimed legislative and executive powers for itself.

Morsi, of course, has actively combated the army&#8217;s efforts to maintain power.  His first bold move as President was to call Parliament back into session, superseding the army&#8217;s orders.  But now, by forcing the retirement of SCAF&#8217;s top generals, Morsi has effectively disabled the army&#8217;s grip on power.

Cleverly, Morsi relied on younger army officers to support this shake-up.  With the old army leaders gone, Morsi was able to give younger army members the most powerful positions.  Since these new leaders owe their positions to Morsi, they are less likely to challenge his power than the Mubarak appointed army leaders Morsi had been dealing with.  The army seems to be, once again, loyal to the president.

Considering that there has been little opposition to Morsi&#8217;s consolidation of presidential powers, Egypt finally appears to be returning to normal.   However, the next step that Egypt needs to take is the creation of a constitution.  After all, a constitution is critical not only to set the powers for each branch of government, but it is also critical to subdue the army in the future.  It is difficult for Morsi to argue that the army has overstepped its powers when there is no formal constitution to dictate those powers.  Additionally, a constitution will give Morsi increased legitimacy, as until now the only legitimacy for his actions has been his democratic election.  And while he is Egypt&#8217;s first democratically elected president ever, it is important to note that the duties of the office were still extremely vague when he was elected.

But even after successfully wresting control from the army, Morsi still faces a conundrum over Egypt&#8217;s courts.  In the past, Egypt&#8217;s courts have sided with SCAF and against Morsi.  The main reason for this is that, like the old members of SCAF, the most powerful judges were appointed by Mubarak and are hesitant to the change that Morsi represents.  Any new constitution will have to respect the judiciary while understanding that current judges may be unwelcome to change.

The most powerful leaders of SCAF defeated, Morsi and his Parliament face a new challenge in drafting a Constitution.  The future of a newly democratic Egypt is at stake, and specific laws must be drawn up to prevent a power struggle in the future.
