Ever since Rick Santorum emerged as the most viable anti-Romney candidate, Newt Gingrich has languished at third place in the polls for the Republican nomination.  Gingrich&#8217;s hopes for a comeback have been based on him winning the primaries in Mississippi and Alabama and using that momentum to launch himself back into the race.  However, people have been quick to point out that even if Gingrich sees a dramatic rise in the polls, it will be almost impossible for him to overcome Romney&#8217;s delegate lead and garner the needed majority of delegates.  Since the odds are stacked so heavily against Gingrich, many have called for him to exit the race.

Gingrich has refused to acquiesce to these demands.  Instead, he points to the possibility of a brokered convention, which would occur if no candidate has garnered a majority of delegates after all the states have voted.  Admittedly, even in the case of a brokered convention, the nomination would most likely be given to the candidate with the plurality of delegates.  Under all reasonable estimates for how the rest of the primaries and caucuses go, this &#8216;plurality&#8217; candidate would be Romney.

Still, Gingrich has pointed out that the plurality candidate does not always win.  Entering the Republican Convention of 1920, front-runner Leonard Wood had a plurality of support.  However, it was Warren Harding who eventually walked away with the nomination and who went on to win the presidency.  Gingrich, using this example to justify his candidacy, remains staunchly in the race.

But why would this help Santorum?  After all, Gingrich holds the support of many conservative voters who would otherwise flock to Santorum&#8217;s campaign.  Romney, being much more moderate, would receive a smaller fraction of Gingrich supporters than Santorum if Mr. Gingrich were to drop out of the race.

The root of this seeming contradiction lies in the ever-important delegate math.  Romney is by far the closest candidate to reaching the 1,144 delegates that would secure him the nomination.  While it is mathematically possible for  Santorum to reach that 1,144 as well, he would have to start winning contests by tremendous proportions in order to usurp Romney.  The chances of this happening are slim to none, meaning that Santorum, much like Gingrich, is essentially trying to survive until a brokered convention.

This means that, for now, both Gingrich and Santorum have similar interests.  By both remaining in the race (in addition to Ron Paul&#8217;s persistent campaign), they complicate Romney&#8217;s efforts to garner the remaining delegates he needs to secure his majority and win the nomination. And even though a majority of Gingrich supporters would most likely turn to Santorum if Gingrich were to drop out, we can&#8217;t ignore the fact that some would decide to support Romney.  Higher percentages of the vote would lead to more delegates awarded for both Romney and Santorum as the remaining states vote.

But Romney&#8217;s delegates are the only ones we need to worry about anymore, as he is the only candidate with a fathomable chance of gaining 1,144 delegates and winning the nomination without a brokered convention.  A post-Gingrich boost could give Romney the support he would need in order to give him that magic number.  At the end of the day, Gingrich&#8217;s stubbornness is actually helping Santorum to have some mathematical chance against Romney.

If Romney does not obtain a majority of the delegates, both Santorum and Gingrich will have an opportunity to win the nomination during a brokered convention.  Still, as of now, Romney seems on track to garner his needed majority before the convention.  However, some doubt remains, and both Santorum and Gingrich are clinging to this possibility.  But if one if them drops, it could be exactly the thing Mitt Romney needs to secure his victory.
