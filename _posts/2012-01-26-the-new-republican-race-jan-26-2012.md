After finishing deep in the pack in New Hampshire, it seemed like all was done for Newt Gingrich.  However, Mr. Gingrich has made many comebacks throughout this election season, and his recent win in South Carolina shows that Romney is not the inevitable candidate many once thought he was.

The question being asked now is if Gingrich will be able to just take South Carolina, where his organization was the strongest, or if he will be able to use this victory to jump into the lead in the next primary state of Florida.  Many Republican voters in Florida have been giving Gingrich a second look after his win in South Carolina.  This has manifested itself in recent polls, as Gingrich&#8217;s popularity has shot up once again and he now virtually ties Romney on a national scale.*  If Gingrich can turn this new support into a win in Florida, he may be able to officially claim the title of front runner.

Romney has also lost the advantage that his fundraising totals once gave him.  The Super-PAC, a type of political action committee that can take in virtually unlimited amounts of money from individuals and corporations, has revolutionized campaign financing in a way that is beneficial to Mr. Gingrich.  After all, several large sums of money have been donated in the last few days to a Super-PAC that is pro-Gingrich.  This means that Gingrich&#8217;s campaign does not need to be as well financed as Mitt Romney&#8217;s in order to be competitive with media advertisements.

Mr. Romney does have a serious money problem of his own: he has too much of it.  After releasing his tax records, millions of Americans realized that Romney was not the &#8216;every-man&#8217; he was making himself out to be.  He made more than 40 million dollars in the last two years, and many fear that he will not be able to connect with everyday working class Americans.

But that is not Mitt Romney&#8217;s only problem.  Mr. Romney&#8217;s more moderate positions often put him at odds with a Republican Party that has been moving farther right.  A proud tea-partier would have a difficult time voting for Romney. On the other hand, Mr. Gingrich holds more conservative beliefs that better resonate with the party at whole.

This does not mean that Newt Gingrich has tackled an easy opponent and is now coasting to the nomination.  Romney&#8217;s campaign has stronger organization, meaning that the same success Romney has enjoyed for months on the campaign trail will not be easily taken from him.  Also, Newt Gingrich has already seen a burst in popularity during December.  Unfortunately for him, he was unable to consolidate and hold on to this support.  A similar situation has now presented itself, and there is no guarantee he will retain the support he currently has.  On the other hand, Mitt Romney&#8217;s support has remained consistent throughout the election season.  If Gingrich&#8217;s surge in the polls is fleeting, expect Romney to quickly reemerge on top.

The election field has narrowed, and the two strong candidates remaining seem ready to duke it out until the very end.  Both remain very close in the polls and neither of them are ready to stop the relentless push for the Republican nomination.
