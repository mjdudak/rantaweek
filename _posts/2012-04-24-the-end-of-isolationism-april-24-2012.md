1796: In his Farewell Address, President George Washington tells Americans that the nation&#8217;s foreign policy should be &#8220;to steer clear of permanent alliances&#8221;.

2012: The United States promises support to the nation of Afghanistan for ten years <span style="text-decoration: underline;">after</span> our planned withdrawal in 2014.

Any contrast of these statements invites the criticism that our ten year pledge of support is not a permanent alliance but merely an extension of a current partnership.  The fallacy behind this argument is that our commitment to fighting terrorism keeps us continuously aligned with the Afghan government.  Even after those ten years have expired in 2024, we will still be forced to collaborate with the Afghans against the Taliban.  This means that while the U.S.- Afghan alliance is not technically permanent, it is indefinite.  Any arguable difference between indefinite and permanent alliances is simply a matter of semantics, as there is no difference in practical applications.  A necessary alliance without a foreseeable end forces the participating countries to accept the alliance as an unchangeable status quo.

So&#8230; why has the United States changed its position from shying away from permanent alliances to now accepting them?  The answer does not come from a radical revision of American foreign policy but instead stems from necessity.  When Washington published his Farewell Address in 1796, America had no vested interest in other countries.  The difference now is that a larger, more modern America has needs that force co-dependence.

The Industrial Revolution is largely to blame.  Washington&#8217;s America was a nation of farmers, and the agriculture industry did not require foreign trade.  However, our modern world requires a steady stream of trade to boost intercontinental economies.  Economic interdependence turns isolationism into economic suicide.  Even trade with countries when no alliances exist (formal or informal) leads to instability.  The search for stability is what has led the United States to pursue a wave of free trade agreements in recent decades, sacrificing George Washington&#8217;s principles for additional assurances about the strength of our trade networks.

Also stemming from the Industrial Revolution is a tremendous need for oil.  Oil powers everyday life in America, and our reserves do not cover our needs.  This has created a reliance America has on other nations, meaning that when the supply of oil is threatened, America has no choice but to intervene.  Washington&#8217;s more self-reliant America did not have these concerns.

Last but perhaps most importantly, additional technology has increased man&#8217;s destructive power, prompting mutual agreements that ruined America&#8217;s last chances for isolationism.  America did not join the League of Nations after World War I, but soon realized the consequences a lack of international dialogue could bring during World War II and became a founding member of the new United Nations.  After Cold War tensions and the threat of nuclear conflicts began, America took the unprecedented step of a mutual defense pact with Europe in the creation of NATO.

America&#8217;s growth, in addition to the growth of technology, has forced the doctrine of isolationism to yield to the new doctrine of interventionism.  And since ever-increasing globalization is causing more interdependence, the trend towards interventionism should continue.

The effects of our interventionism are varied.  The most obvious and straightforward effect has been the dramatic rise in our defense costs.  It costs about $700 billion a year to be the &#8216;world&#8217;s policeman&#8217;.  Even adjusting for inflation, defense budgets before World War II were a fraction of what they are today.

In addition, near constant interventionism has made America a divisive force.  Reactions are mixed to America&#8217;s often controversial actions.  America is now defined by the interventions it makes.

Lastly, America&#8217;s interventionism has caused the world as a whole to be distinctly more American.  The United States has a dominant role in world policy that causes the rest of the world to rely more than ever on American support.  This again increases interdependence, but the tide is shifting as China is beginning to make its imprint on world policy and expand its spheres of influence, proving interdependence is not a static relationship.

Our pledge to continue support for Afghanistan is expected.  It only continues on the path of increased interventionism that America has followed for decades.  The modern world has forced the U.S. to shed Washington&#8217;s idealism for a new reality.
