Yesterday, the very first step on the way to the Republican Presidential Nomination took place: the Iowa Caucuses. The Iowa Caucuses have always been historic for being the very first in the series of caucuses and primaries on the road to the Nominating Convention. This year, Romney went into Iowa caucus in the same position he has been this entire time, a front runner and moderate that appeals to many. By now, Cain had completely faded away (although he did receive 58 votes in Iowa), Perry had become a minor contestant, and Bachmann became a joke. Gingrich&#8217;s surge was fading and it seemed as if he was about done. Suddenly, Paul starts to surge and people expect him to do very well. But then, even more suddenly, and out of nowhere, Santorum&#8217;s popularity shoots up out of nowhere. While he is still polling at only 8%, he showed strong performance in Iowa. Ultimately, in Iowa, Romney beat out Santorum by only 8 votes, which took well into the early morning to count, with third going to Ron Paul (who happened to get well over twice as many votes as he did in 2008). However, the question surrounding Iowa is how much it really matters. In 2008, Huckabee took Iowa and then fell to only win 8 states overall. So while Romney still does seem to have the best chance at a bid currently, there is certainly no guarantee.

Also significant is the fact that the caucuses actually have no effect on the delegates who will end up going to the Nominating Convention. Rather, the precint elects delegates for the county conventions, where they elect delegates for the district conventions, where they elect delegates for the Iowa State Convention, where they finally elect delegates for the Nominating Convention. Yes, I know, confusing but this is how it works. Now, even with that there are 3 of the 28 Iowa delegates who are not bound to the caucus/convention results, but rather get to choose whoever they wish. Basically, it makes no sense why people care so much about these results, since they are not binding. Although, we can generally make a guess at who will get the delegates, with them being split up proportionally. With these results, most are predicting that Romney will receive 13 and Santorum will receive 12. Although since they are barely binding, and only a few of the thousands of delegates that get sent to the Nominating Conventions, it can be confusing why we care so much.

The answer to that question is that Iowa can provide insight into the future of the race. Not only does it show who is doing well, but it also may be a necessary springboard for candidates that are not well known. People always look to Iowa simply because it is first, and if someone who has not been receiving much support does well in Iowa, we can assume that more people will look at them as a viable candidate. Up until yesterday, Santorum was not very well known, however he received a push at the last minute and has since flown to the forefront of national politics. His poll numbers will likely start to rise, and he will likely fair well in New Hampshire next Tuesday. So while Iowa remains to have very little direct impact on the election in the end, it will indirectly impact how voters look at candidates. Already, Bachmann decided a continued run was not worth it after only receiving 5%. Therefore, we emerge from the dust of Iowa with a better understanding of what may end up happening later in the election.

As a note, Cain did have an impact on the caucuses, because the 58 votes that he received could have swung the results one way or the other. Also, a little known candidate, Buddy Roemer could have had virtually this same impact, receiving 31 votes. If you do not know who he is, look him up.
