When much of Europe came together under the eurozone, the plan was to create a monetary union through the adoption of a common currency.  The ECB, or European Central Bank, was formed in order to help guide and direct policy.  But other than that, very little was done to cement the union.  Proximity and convenience seemed to be the reasons why the euro was so popular.  And while there were economic criteria that a country needed for inclusion, these criteria were often ignored to preserve openness to neighbors.  Unfortunately, this led to countries like Greece being allowed into the eurozone when they should have been denied.  European leaders have learned this mistake the hard way, as Greece&#8217;s problems are currently sending shock-waves throughout Europe.  And now, the eurozone must find a way to save itself.

The problems Europe faces, however, are massive, as billions upon billions of dollars worth of ballooning debts are hard to cut down to size.  And if any one country defaults, losses that the other eurozone countries would take as a result of this might force them into default as well.  This phenomenon, known as debt contagion, creates a domino effect of collapsing European economies that serves as a worst-possible outcome for the debt crisis.  Wanting to avert this, European leaders have two main paths to follow.  The first is to disband the union by forcing weaker countries to stop using the euro.  The other option is basically the opposite, strengthening the union by having the ECB exert tighter controls over member nations.

It is this second option that Europe has been following.  This fact is best displayed in the slew of bailouts that the ECB has presided over.  In loaning out hundreds of billions of euros to troubled nations, the bank has tied the fate of Europe even closer together.  And because they have so much money at risk, the ECB has taken a new stand in dictating policies.  This is morphing the eurozone from a purely economic institution into a political institution as well.  Politics do affect the economy, and bank leaders recognize that political action is needed to change the economic tide in countries such as Greece and Italy, where political deadlock begot economic woes.  The ECB is now looking for greater control in countries like these, which will mean much more oversight from the eurozone as a group and lead to individual countries losing full sovereignty over their political futures.

But what does this mean for the future of the eurozone?  More than anything else, it demonstrates how political and economic fates are intertwined.  Debt is an economic instrument, but it often creates political effects.  America&#8217;s own history involves the assumption of state debts by the federal government in order to consolidate the individual states under the Constitution.  A very similar occurrence is happening in Europe, with very similar results.  New laws and methods of operation are being formulated to weld the fates of eurozone members together.  A stronger central government for the eurozone (and possibly the E.U.) may result.  This will change the way the world views Europe, but also the way Europe views itself.  After all, Germany&#8217;s problems aren&#8217;t just Germany&#8217;s problems, and Greece&#8217;s issues don&#8217;t just belong to Greece.  The eurozone nations are becoming more aware of faults in other member states, and are clamoring as a group to fix the problems before they themselves are affected.  Consolidation of power is the only logical result.

A more unified Europe may mean tighter austerity cuts to problem nations, but Europe in the end is worrying for itself as a whole.  Together, eurozone nations legislated themselves into this mess, and together, they must find a way out.
