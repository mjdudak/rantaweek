-I would like to also give my thanks to Jonny B., Angela Y., Julia N., and Ned L., who helped tremendously but actually stayed on-topic, meaning their posts (unlike the ones above) make sense.  To hunt for more funny posts, visit our [archived liveblogs.](http://rantaweek.com/live-blogs/ "Live Blogs")
