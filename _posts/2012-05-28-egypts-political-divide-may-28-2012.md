Last year, the Egyptian people witnessed an Arab Spring revolution that toppled Hosni Mubarak, its autocratic leader.  However, since then, the nation has encountered serious problems in the process of turning itself into a democracy.  As we have [previously pointed out](http://rantaweek.com/egyptian-elections-may-2012/ "Egyptian Elections – May 9, 2012"), the military has held onto power for too long and the public is unhappy with many of its choices for the future.  But on a positive note, elections were successfully held last week to narrow the field of presidential candidates down to two.  The chosen candidates were Ahmed Shafik, the last Prime Minister under Hosni Mubarak, and Mohammed Morsi, an Islamist candidate from the Muslim Brotherhood.

These two candidates highlight the main divide that Egypt has faced during its transitional period.  Shafik represents the opinion that Egypt does not need a fundamental change to bring itself into the post-Mubarak era and instead needs only a change in command.  Morsi, as the candidate of the Muslim Brotherhood, showcases the more liberal belief that political Islam, which was a platform for dissent against Mubarak before the revolution, should rise up to take Mubarak&#8217;s place in the revolution&#8217;s wake.

So far, the ideology represented by Morsi has won out.  In previously held parliamentary elections, Morsi&#8217;s party won a plurality of the seats, and another Islamist party won the second-highest amount.  However, in the months since the parliamentary elections, a conservative movement against this change has grown, leading to the popularity of candidates like Shafik.

While Morsi garnered approximately 250,000 more votes than Shafik in the first round of voting, there is no guarantee that he will win the second round of elections in June.  The large number of candidates in the first round meant that neither Morsi or Shafik won a majority of the vote.  Actually, neither candidate topped 25%!  Additionally, on a percentage basis, Morsi only edged out Shafik by slightly more than 1% of the total votes cast.

Another interesting statistic is voter turnout, which was much lower for the presidential election than it was for the parliamentary elections several months ago.  The turnout, which was under 50%, shows a disconnect between politics and voters.  The exact cause is unknown, but Egyptians may have been unsatisfied with the candidates or simply unexcited about the issues so soon after parliamentary elections.  Still, no matter the reason, voter fatigue seems strange when a revolution has just occurred.

Ultimately, Morsi and Shafik represent two different paths for Egypt&#8217;s future.  Each candidate and ideology has its strengths and weaknesses.  However, the best thing about Egypt&#8217;s new democratic foundation is the hope that if one plan doesn&#8217;t work out, support will shift to new candidates and better ideologies.  That, at least, is a far cry from the Mubarak era.
