While Herman Cain has only officially suspended his campaign and not fully nullified it, the chances of him surging to reclaim his former status as a front runner are virtually nothing.  A series of sexual harassment allegations, followed by news of a more than decade long affair accomplished the inevitable: a loss of popularity.

But more importantly than Herman Cain losing votes is the fact that Newt Gingrich has managed to garner the support of many disgruntled former Cain backers.  Gingrich&#8217;s rise in the polls has coincided with Cain&#8217;s downfall.  Now that Cain is no longer actively running for the nomination, more of his supporters may follow the trend and switch to Gingrich.  This is crucial timing, as the first primaries and caucuses are now only a month away.  Gingrich needs to be able to hold on to these supporters until the first states cast their votes in order to show that he, like Romney, is a serious candidate who can rally a base and hold on to it.  A slew of Republican candidates so far have had no problems in rallying the conservative base, but they all have had no luck in maintaining consistently high poll numbers.  The exception to this rule is Mr. Romney, who has managed to receive front-runner status for his entire campaign so far.  However, he has failed to truly create excitement and is considered more of a compromise candidate than anything else.

Now that the race is narrowing down to a Romney v. Gingrich contest, the question to be asked is whether or not Gingrich can beat Romney.  As of right now, the advantage must be given to Mr. Romney, as consistency tends to trump hype over the course of an election.  This does not mean that Gingrich should not be taken seriously.  After all, if he can maintain his positive intensity, he will prove himself to voters and show that he can create more excitement than the oft stale Romney.  And yet there are plenty of bumps to block Gingrich&#8217;s path forward.  Like Cain, Gingrich has distracting allegations of sexual misdeeds in his past.  An increased media spotlight on Mr. Gingrich will mean increased media scrutiny, prompting further discussions on this uncomfortable subject.

Gingrich also needs to show through televised debates and televised appearances that he has fresh ideas for the country.  Voters need substance, not just style from a campaign in order to truly feel connected with it.  Still, Gingrich has the advantage of holding more conservative views than Romney, and can pick up voters who feel Romney is too much of a moderate.  Whether or not he decides to focus on this during debates remains to be seen, but leveraging Romney&#8217;s more moderate positions in his favor could be a useful tool.  This will only work, however, if Newt Gingrich has some policies of his own that he can use to convince the electorate that he is the right choice to go up against Obama.

In what appears to be a Romney v. Gingrich race, Gingrich is the newcomer.  His campaign strategy over the next few weeks will determine his strength in key early states such as Iowa and New Hampshire.  The wrong decisions for Gingrich could cost him the election, as Romney will be able to coast on his steady support.  One thing is most certainly becoming clear, that this election is developing into an exciting one.
