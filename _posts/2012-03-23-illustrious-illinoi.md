As previously reported, Mitt Romney took another state under his belt this Tuesday, winning 43 of the 63 Illinois delegates. However, the actual impact of this victory is questioned. So let us once again go through, candidate by candidate, the Illinois results.

First up, Ron Paul. Ron Paul&#8217;s position in the race has not changed much in Illinois. The only change is that he beat Newt Gingrich, and while this may seem like it would make Gingrich mad enough to finally quit, he has vowed to remain in the race. Paul at this point in time is basically still just a bystander in the race. He may detract from Santorum winning, but he will likely not drop out, so we ought to get used to him in the race.

Next, Gingrich. As previously stated, he has vowed to stay in. He has vowed to do so on the grounds that he wants to prevent Romney from winning the campaign. Perhaps he read [our article](http://rantaweek.com/why-gingrich-is-helping-santorum/ "Why Gingrich Is Helping Santorum â€“ March 12, 2012") and realized that he actually can hurt Romney. Regardless, we ought to get used to him as well, and see if he ultimately does help Santorum.

Now onto the big two. Romney now has 563 delegates, which is currently a majority but only about half of the 1144 number needed. With needing to win 581 of the remaining 1273 delegates, he still has a long way to go. However, winning Illinois proves that Romney can win states that should easily be his, which is showing his campaign is strong again after almost slipping up in Michigan. Moreover, and most importantly, a weak showing in Illinois proves Santorum&#8217;s weakness. Illinois was his shot to prove that he is still capable of being the upset. But with not winning, his viability as an underdog candidate winning in other states is immensely weakened. If he won in Illinois, Santorum would have shown an unexpected strength in a state where his primary support demographic is not dominant. Illinois is by no means known for it&#8217;s evangelical or ultra conservative voters, but rather is fairly liberal and moderate. However, with the remaining states also lacking Santorum&#8217;s favorite demographic, Santorum will face an immense uphill battle. While Romney only needs 581 of the delegates, Santorum needs 881 to clinch the nomination. The main states that Santorum can look for a strong evangelical turnout that remain are Texas and Louisiana. However there are many remaining liberal or moderate states that have yet to elect delegates which will largely outweigh these states, including Pennsylvania and California. So while Romney may only have a slight lead right now, unless he does horribly in the remaining states, his nomination seems likely. In order to show a glimmer of a chance, Santorum must win a state that is more diverse than just his demographic.

So while not much of the race has changed, through lacking a strong turnout in Illinois, Santorum shows his weakness, and one that will be hard to overcome in the remaining states. Illinois will unlikely go towards the Republican candidate, whoever it may be, and Romney winning does not change much. The stakes of Illinois were much higher for Santorum, yet he did not do well enough to prove anything. Santorum will continue to face an increasingly hard uphill battle, but if he can prove soon that it is not only conservatives that like him, only then will he show true viability.
