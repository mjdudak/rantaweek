Back in 2010, Republicans and Democrats battled over the extent to which the Bush Tax Cuts needed to be extended.  Democrats were in favor of extending the cuts, but only for income under $250,000.  They argued that Americans making over $250,000 did not need the tax break.  Republicans, on the other hand, felt that it was unfair to raise taxes on anyone in a poor economy, and that doing so would hurt growth.

Democratic hopes quickly faded after they came up short of the 60 votes needed to break a Republican filibuster in the Senate.  Just weeks before the cuts were due to expire and still without an extension, lawmakers were afraid that nothing would be done and no extension would occur.  Fearing voter anger that would come along with a tax hike, enough bipartisan support emerged for the Republican plan, allowing it to be passed and eventually signed by President Obama.

The current problem?  The extension agreed to in 2010 was only for two years, meaning the tax cuts are set to expire at the end of 2012.  Obama has recently voiced support for the original Democratic plan, saying that the extension should continue only for incomes under $250,000.  G.O.P presidential candidate Romney, on the other hand, wants to extend the cuts for all income levels.

It sounds like the same battle as before, but one key component of the debate has changed: timing.  Since the cuts will not expire until after the election, Obama has the advantage of making tax policy an issue leading up to the election while not having to make any controversial decisions until afterwards.  And even if Romney wins, Obama will still hold office until January 20th, which is 20 days after the cuts expire.  Win or lose, Obama will have the last say on the cuts.

Politically, this puts Obama in a better situation than before.  Back in 2010 and after the Republicans effectively killed the Democratic plan, Obama had two options.  The first was backing the Republican plan and allowing an extension he only partially agreed with.  The second was creating a stalemate that could potentially result in an across-the-board tax increase.  Obama avoided the latter because it was politically dangerous.  After the election, whether he wins or loses, Obama will not have to worry as much about voter retaliation and will likely not give in to the opposition as easily.

Still, Obama failed to pass the Democratic plan in 2010 when Democrats controlled both houses.  This time around, Republicans control the House of Representatives.  Since the Constitution mandates that &#8220;all bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives&#8221;, Republicans will have significant control over any bill that is proposed.

Obama will be in a more powerful position to deal with this controversial issue after the election.   However, the Republicans will have a more profound say on any proposed tax bill than they did in 2010, when they controlled neither house and had to use filibuster power to prevent Obama&#8217;s proposal from passing.  Both sides are stronger, meaning the nation should be ready for a more hard-fought and deeper discussion over the extensions when compared to 2010.  American voters shouldn&#8217;t expect this issue to disappear anytime soon, as a long political battle seems sure to come.
