Led by the Tea Party, many House Republicans have vowed to not vote for any bill that raises taxes, saying that doing so in the middle of the current economic climate would only heap additional fiscal worries onto the backs of already stressed Americans. And in many ways, this is true, especially with unemployment hovering just over 9%<sup>(1)</sup>. On the other side, the commonly touted Democratic plan is to raise the tax burden on the wealthy. Republicans have countered by calling such a move class warfare and thus unfair. But really, what is fairness in the tax system?

The rich have been getting richer; there is no doubt about that. The top 1% had 7.5% of after-tax income in 1979. By 2007, the top 1% had increased their share by more than twofold, to 17.1 %<sup>(2)</sup>. In that same time period, the top income tax rate fell from 70% of income to 35%<sup>(3)</sup>. But we must be honest, as the top tax rate in America means little to nothing without looking at the piles upon piles of different deductions that the tax code allows. And this is one of the largest problems that faces United States taxation policies today. The Simpson-Bowles Commission estimated that hundreds of billions of extra revenue could be collected over the next ten years through a reformation of our tax code that, while eliminating many common deductions, would actually lower the “official” tax rates on both individuals and corporations<sup>(4)</sup>. Loopholes in tax policies allow many wealthy Americans and corporations to pay much lower tax rates than one might suspect. This has lead Warren Buffett to call for a billionaire tax on the wealthiest of Americans. Plans proposed with Buffett’s ideas in mind are asking a little more of cash-laden moguls and businesses that have accumulated their wealth under the auspices of our great nation. The fear, however, is that those businesses will move American jobs away if their taxes are increased. In the muddle of hotly tinged and often ill-informed debate that follows taxation, is there a correct way forward?

As far as individuals are concerned, the ultra-rich have the ability to pay higher taxes, and with the nation in dire fiscal straits, the idea of higher-income tax brackets is a good one to create more revenue. The question of ‘fairness’ when dealing with this tax is a loaded question from the beginning, but with that 17.1% of after-tax income currently going to the top 1% of American families, there is certainly room for some redistribution of wealth to occur. In addition, luxury taxes (a la Monopoly) are a feasible way to accomplish the game goal. The taxation of corporations is a more difficult matter. Outsourcing is a concern, and the tax code needs to be reworked to give a helping hand to companies who have shown a commitment to creating jobs in America and put pressure on those who outsource while still trying to make a tidy profit here at home. While this is, of course, easier said than done, average Americans can help by making sure their lawmakers stay away from the thick wallets of special-interest lobbyists. After all, it is the constituents, not the lobbyists, who have the final say on representatives’ actions. Average Americans also need to realize that their lax taxes will not last forever. The Bush tax cuts are often excluded from budget estimates because they do have an expiration date. While lawmakers are always keen to prevent a tax hike and have extended these tax breaks before, it will be harder and harder to even think of a balanced budget amidst the rising costs of healthcare and Social Security if these cuts remain in place permanently. The current economic doldrums will not be forever, but these expensive cuts also can not last.

In conclusion, the tax code must be changed. Countries around the world, especially in Europe, are working towards a more stable future using many of the measures discussed here. America has problems of its own, and these need to be addressed in the tax system. Cutting government costs can do a good job of mending the deficit, but in the long haul and taking into consideration the ever-rising costs modern governments have to deal with, a better tax code is nothing less than a necessity. -TM
