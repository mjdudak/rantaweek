A lot of news comes out of Pakistan, and the news we receive is rarely good.  The latest fears that have come from Pakistan deal with a possible military coup, similar to a previous coup that the country suffered in 1999.  However, since a coup could destabilize the country, it is a good idea to examine why many think one is possible in the first place.

The largest argument for why a coup seems imminent is that the army&#8217;s power is surging.  Instead of only dealing in military matters, army leaders are also engaging in the political sphere as well.  Recently, a critique of the army&#8217;s actions by the Prime Minister was met with threatening remarks from the army.  Government leaders, on the other hand, have shown themselves to have little control over the army by not countering oversteps of the army&#8217;s influence like this.  By increasingly asserting their political control, the military has positioned themselves in a dominant position not just militarily, but politically as well.

Another factor that makes people worry about the possibility of a coup is President Zardari&#8217;s travels.  He recently flew to Dubai for a wedding, but he was also in Dubai for more than a week during December for medical reasons.  With Zardari out of the country, the military would find it easier to take power.  His presence in the country could make it harder to depose him, but the military might find things less complicated when he is abroad.  Also, Zardari&#8217;s government is seen as increasingly corrupt by Pakistan&#8217;s citizens, and dissatisfaction with the government is rising.  This political climate is very similar to before the 1999 coup, where the government was also disliked.  The army might hope that a majority of the Pakistani people would cheer the downfall of this corrupt government and hope they fare better under the rule of military leaders.

However, even with these strengths, military leaders have stated that they are not planning any coup.  There would of course be international backlash to such a coup, and there is no guarantee that the Pakistani people would support one.  Military leaders may also fear that a coup could inspire Arab Spring style protests as the people would reject being ruled by an unelected leadership.  Some things do seem in place for a coup in Pakistan, but army leaders feel safer with mere expansion of their powers and don&#8217;t want to make the very risky move of taking complete control.  Even with Zardari still in power, the military has seen their authority grow.  Thus, a coup in Pakistan is possible, but should not necessarily be expected.

After all, hot tempers have been cooling off, as Zardari has met with the head of the army to talk things over.  This further demonstrates that, while there are tensions amongst the most powerful leaders in Pakistan, the military still respects Zardari&#8217;s control.  Fears of a coup may exist, but it seems that the ultimate conclusion will be a lot less serious.
