      Thank you for joining us today for our Michigan Live Blog! With Romney winning both Michigan and Arizona, he looks to have some momentum leading in to Super Tuesday. We hope you will join us next week for our Super Tuesday live blog. Also, check back tomorrow for a full length article analyzing these results, and what they mean for the rest of the primaries as well as the general election!

      To summarize my opinions about tonight:

    <ul>
      <li>
        I want Santorum to be a flavor of the month

        I think this primary isn&#8217;t as important as some people think

      The main reason I ask about Biden is because early last year there were some rumors about switching Hillary Clinton and Biden. However these rumors were stifled when Clinton basically said she is about done at the end of this term.

      Don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s necessary, but it certainly helps. Think about how powerful an Obama/Clinton ticket would have been. I think they would have been unstoppable. There are just no high-profile Republican women who are sufficiently popular enough to take on the job.

      Matthew, why would Obama make the unnecessary risk of kicking Biden out? Still, I&#8217;m actually looking forward to the VP debate&#8230; another chance to make fun of Biden&#8217;s hair plugs.

      I dont know how confident I would be in calling Romney already but its looking good for him. I still think we are overestimating the importance of these primaries. Tonight the news will report that Romney won his home state and a state they called the verdict on basically before voting even started. If anything this will do absolutely nothing to his success on Tuesday

      Back to results for a second&#8230; Romney has a 4% lead with 69% of the vote in. I&#8217;m pretty ready to call this one for Romney. But what does a double win today mean for Romney leading up to and on Super Tuesday?

      I think Christie would not ask for it, but if offered it would. I think he would feel it sort of his duty. Also, I think Hunstman is a very logical choice for Secretary of State should there be a Republican White House.

      I think the biggest thing about the VP is that they must be articulate and very careful. After the first debate, everybody was just waiting for Palin to make another mistake (which she did) and then they jumped on her. Also, I&#8217;m not entirely sure McCain had actually met Palin prior to naming her VP&#8230;that is also important to learn from.

      You really want Santorum to be just a flavor-of-the-month, don&#8217;t you? And I think it just shows that Santorum is surging, if you&#8217;ll excuse the potential innuendo. Romney&#8217;s voters have known they want him for a long time, while diehard conservatives have been shopping around for a while.

      VP&#8217;s? I bet they&#8217;d try to stay within the pool of candidates for the nomination, but I could see them going for someone like Pawlenty or even Huntsman. Whoever it is, it is going to be a very moderate, safe choice. Unless they&#8217;re stupid.

      Im going back to my flavor of the month thing. In the CNN exit poll, Santorum&#8217;s voters made their decision this month or in the last couple of days while Romney&#8217;s votes were from a longer time frame (or the day of). Does this give Santorum momentum or pose for his lead to disappear in the next weeks?

      Hunstman would make a good one, but doesn&#8217;t have the popularity for a candidate to chose him. Chris Christie seems logical as well, but he doesn&#8217;t seem interested. Rubio would help get minority votes away from Obama.

      Take away the Detroit metropolitan area and Romney&#8217;s lead is gone. Santorum has quite a sway over more rural voters. He&#8217;s also (almost) won the entire Upper Peninsula.

      Also, back to the economy standpoint. In the exit polls, Romney also got the most voters who had a family member laid off in the last three years. I would venture to say that this means people have confidence in Romney&#8217;s ability to heal the economy over Santorum.

      Romney has unsurprisingly taken the richer and more educated population in Michigan, while Santorum took more workers and union members.

      Here is bad news from AZ exit polls though. Romney&#8217;s showing among Hispanic voters was a bit lower than expected. This could bode poorly for him come November if he is facing Obama in Florida.

      Robbie: I&#8217;ll agree to that for the general election, but I think that on-the-ground efforts are hugely important in the primaries.

      Robert: I do agree that infighting normally happens durring a second term election. However, with the Republican party as ideologically fragmented as it is, the failure to unite behind a single candidate is a continuation of an already existing problem. If this continues much longer, it is possible some Republican voters will become fed up and not vote in the general election. So I believe at this stage they need to unite in order to keep voters confidence in the party. I could be exaggerating the matter, but there is some truth in what I&#8217;m saying.

      Well, the infighting does seem worse this time around, but remember that Obama and Clinton basically went almost to the convention in 2008. It could be true that a hotly contested race could have the winning candidate coming out very strong. The real problem is going to be the money &#8211; Republicans need to have some really solid fundraising if they&#8217;re going to be able to stand up to Obama.

      I think we&#8217;re overemphasizing the infighting as well. This happens every election for a second term. One party has a candidate, the other fights for a while. There is still a strong possibility that republicans could prove successful with the economy being as shaky as it is. Especially with Greece getting so close to full default, this would play havok on the stocks and anyone watching those would be very nervous about the upcoming months

      More importantly, every week of infighting is more money that is split while Obama is piling up the money. Republicans need to fundraise behind one candidate earlier to make an impact against his money supply.

      I think Michigan is hurting both Santorum&#8217;s and Romney&#8217;s momentum. But with Romney&#8217;s inevitable win in Arizona will still put him slightly ahead of Rick.

      Alright, what about Santorum&#8217;s chances of surviving until a brokered convention? I for one think it comes down to Super Tuesday, but I feel that today will impact who has momentum going into Super Tuesday.

      Everyone knows that Michigan was going to be a very close contest, so with a small-margin win by Romney, Santorum would still be very much in contention for Super Tuesday.

      Well he&#8217;s certainly not strengthened. If Romney wins, it may help him on Super Tuesday. I still am cautious about overestimating the importance of this particular primary though in terms of how many people are watching the results. My parents for example are much too busy watching NCIS: NY (I think). Honestly I dont know if they even know there is a primary today.

      I would like to jump back to the flavor of the month discussion. In looking at a poll chart of the RCP average, Santorum received his first jump in the polls in early January and only passed Romney at the beginning of this month. Romney on the other hand has been consistently high. I just can&#8217;t believe that Santorum will be able to hold this lead long enough to get the nomination.

      I think if you&#8217;re a moderate Republican though, you&#8217;re kind of pushing for a brokered convention. Gingrich supporters would probably move to Santorum, and Paul has more in common with him than with Romney&#8230;

      No one would have a majority of the delegates going into the convention&#8230; and an arrangement would have to be worked out.

      I think much of the length of this race could also depend upon if Paul or Gingrich is willing to give up their campaign. Many of the states have been close enough that if their supporters swung to one or the other candidate, they would be the deciding factor. I think they both need to realize that by staying in the election, they are hurting any Republican&#8217;s chances as a general election candidate by drawing out the process.

      Let&#8217;s talk about the length of this nomination process. I originally (in late December) thought Romney could wrap up the nomination by Florida, but now the contest looks as if it could persist past Super Tuesday. Is a brokered convention in our future?

      With 14% reporting, it is still too close to tell. Santorum has a lead of about two thousand votes, but only 1%, and there is simply no clear front runner.

      Michigan&#8217;s laws say that the primary must take place at specific times, and after the RNC demanded they move the primary, they had two options: ignore the RNC and lose delegates, or move it to May and become irrelevant. They chose a loss in power over irrelevance.

      ALSO, something interesting and unrelated to current discussions: Michigan lost half its delegates because its holding its primary at the wrong time. What would motivate them to do that other than to be more important media-wise. Does their government not care about having a possible presidential candidate from their own state? That would be a very attractive deal for me if I were a state.

      Well to support the Gingrich possibilities, CNN has him leading Arizona with a total of 0% of the votes so far, tied only with everyone else on the ballot. What im trying to say here is Arizona should finish faster and that Gingrich has nothing going where there are actual votes so far.

Our GDP may have grown last quarter, but there are still millions of Americans out of work, many of whom had voted for Obama in the first place because they were unsatisfied with Bush and the Republicans. Those millions have a very strong reason to switch parties in the general election if Romney instills economic confidence in them.

      Obamneycare probably just makes Mitt look bad. 72% of voters found the individual mandate unconstitutional, and association with that (warranted or no) is not good for any politician at the moment.

      With the two leading Republicans seeming to to turn the other sector or Republicans, it will be interesting to see if there is an independent who could split the Republican vote. Ron Paul has already vowed not to, but will there be any others?

      Personally I would consider voting republican if Romney gained the nomination. If Santorum did however, that essentially automatically puts my vote on Obama. So I guess what I&#8217;m trying to say here is that Santorum is too extreme to attract the moderate republicans.

      Well, certainly as long as Santorum is around, Romney won&#8217;t pick up the far right. Too many things about him are a turn-off to that sector, including, unfortunately, his Massachusetts healthcare reform and his religion.

      Romney seems to be winning, however, in the earliest of votes that we have coming from Detroit. Since this is a large population cluster, a win in Detroit may help Romney take a lead as the night progresses. And yes, Robbie, you are right. But Romney may still be missing the help he was supposed to receive from these voters.

      He&#8217;s too controversial socially.

      Interesting point Bradley, but will Romney fail to pick up the far right that Santorum rallies so easily? Also, Santorum has an early lead&#8230; which is something that I did not expect. Romney was supposed to have a large lead among early voters. However, it is hard to tell where these votes are coming from.

      The NYT shows Santorum in the lead in Michigan with 47% of the vote, Romney with 34% and Paul trailing at just 13%.

      Also, Santorum still has conservative enough views that not only will he not pick up many Democrats, this move is probably not seen as anything more than trying to prove his viability in the general election.

      True, but the numbers make it hard to pin on Santorum alone.

      Interesting&#8230; although any fraction of a percent may end up being the difference between a win and a loss.

      Exit polling data doesn&#8217;t seem to show any notable cross-over voting. I&#8217;m trying to find the numbers, but if I recall about 10% of voters claimed to identify as Democrats, compared to 7% in 2008 and 17% in 2000. Makes it hard to tell if Santorum&#8217;s efforts to reach out even mattered.

      Here&#8217;s a question for you all. Santorum has been accused of trying to lure Democratic voters. Will this backfire or will it be worth it if it pushes him to victory?

      On another note: Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) announced today she will not be seeking re-election in the Senate, citing the &#8220;partisanship of recent years in the Senate&#8221;. With her gone and Romney&#8217;s candidacy in question, it could be a bad night for moderate Republicans.

      One of the big things that we will notice when the first results come in is a large lead in early voting that will go to Romney. The result will be that Santorum may spend much of the evening playing catch-up.

      Tonight: Michigan and Arizona. Romney looks to have Arizona sewn up, but Michigan is anyone&#8217;s game. Nate Silver won&#8217;t even call it, which must mean it&#8217;s close.

      Thank you all for joining us at the Michigan Primary Live Blog here on RantAWeek. The first results should be coming in momentarily now that voting has closed. Tonight should be very exciting as polls have predicted that the margin of victory will be razor-slim. If Santorum can pull off a victory here in Romney&#8217;s native state, it could signal that he will be a serious threat against Romney for the nomination. If Romney, on the other hand, manages a double win both here and in Arizona later tonight, he can regain momentum and severely lower Santorum&#8217;s attempts to usurp his role as front-runner.
