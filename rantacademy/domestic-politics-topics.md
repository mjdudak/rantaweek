**These are generalizations about party policies.** Not every politician from one of the two parties will necessarily agree with these platforms.

**Economics**

Democrats: For the most part, Democrats favor a more Keynesian economic policy. Higher taxing, with more government spending is viewed as better. In the opinion of Democrats, jobs and stimulus needs to come from somewhere, and the government is best suited to do so. For this reason, inflationary policy is generally favored. Additionally, Democrats believe that government spending should cover all areas. Ranging from healthcare, to education, to public works, government spending is the only true way to kickstart an economy, argue Democrats. With this government spending should also come a more equal system of wealth distribution.

Republicans: Republicans, on the other hand take the stance of a more laissez-faire system. Government ought to simply step out more and let business be the true job creators and economic simulators. Many Republicans would argue that lower taxes will put more money in the hands of businesses who can then spend it to create jobs. Republicans are generally against government involvement in economics and would rather let professionals work it out.

**Foreign Policy**

In foreign policy especially, polarization of policy has been increasingly minimal. Bleeding of foreign policy between the parties is very common.

Democrats: Generally, Democrats believe that when dealing with foreign policy, multilateralism is a must. In short, the US must be a large player in all issues of foreign policy. They must be a big actor on the international stage. Also, this involvement must only take the form of military action as a last-ditch effort. All diplomatic, economic and political forms of intervention must be exhausted first.

Republicans: Republicans believe that foreign policy is more about forming a few key alliances and maintaining those alliances. While more peaceful means of intervention should be tried, military involvement is generally thought of quicker.

**Social Issues**

Democrats: Often, but not always, Democrats are more liberal about social issues. Policy issues which Democrats are often in favor of include gay marriage, affirmative action, pro-choice, gun control, strong separation of church and state, education and availability of contraception, and looser drug laws.

Republicans: Often, but not always, Republicans are more conservative about social issues. Policy issues which Republicans are often in favor of include traditional marriage, pro-life, loose gun control, tight drug laws, and looser separation of church and state.
